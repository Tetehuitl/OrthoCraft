*This hymn is sung during the Trisagion service for the dead.*
    
"Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. 
Open to me the doors of repentance O Lifegiver; for my spirit rises early to pray towards Thy Holy Temple, bearing the temple of my body all defiled. But in Thy Compassion purify me by the loving kindness of Thy Mercy. 
Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen. 
Lead me on the paths of Salvation O Mother of God, for I have covered my soul in shameful sins and have wasted my life in lazy acts. But by your intercessions, deliver me from all impurity. Have mercy on me O God according to Thy Great Mercy and according to the multitude of Thy Compassions blot out my transgressions. 
When I think of the many evil things I have done, wretched I am, I tremble at the fearful day of Judgement, but trusting in Thy loving kindness, like David I cry to Thee. 
Have mercy on me O God, have mercy on me O God, Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great Mercy."
