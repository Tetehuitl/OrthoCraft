The Prologue from Ohrid is a publication, usually printed in two volumes, that is compilation of individual entries on lives of saints of the Orthodox Church. The Prologue is the work Nikolai Velimirovic, a bishop and saint of the Orthodox Church who lived from 1880 to 1956.

The entries for individual saints is organized by the date of their feast day. In addition to a short biography or "life of a saint" the Prologue also included hymns, reflections, and homilies, usually related to a particular saint. It was originally written in Serbian and is now available in translation. St. Nikolai is often referred to as the Serbian "Chrysostom".

St. Nikolai wrote the Ochridski Prolog (The Prologue of Ohrid) during a period in 1928 when he was in Serbia. He patterned his work after the ancient hagiographical literature in which he wrote brief Lives and edifying incidents of the lives of the men and women, including ordinary sinners.
