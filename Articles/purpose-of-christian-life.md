# The Purpose of Christian Life

Featured: No
Status: Reviewing

The highest thing in the Church is not to understand the Bible. It’s not to understand all the heresies and theological counters. It’s not to adhere to all the canons. It’s not being the most acetic. It’s not doing the most good deeds or even just more good deeds than bad deeds. The ultimate thing in the Church is to become God, as St. Athanasios puts it.

I think many of us don’t believe that we can become saints, and this is why we end up making a priority of one of the lessor things. I’ve even heard a lot of people saying that they won’t go to heaven, as if this is something pious to say. Of course, we should know we don’t deserve heaven, but the virtue Christ tells us to have, along with faith and love, is hope–hope in God’s mercy and salvation.

We should always remember that God is only love. There is no wrath or vindictiveness in him. If we experience a difficult situations–a slap from him, so to speak–this is only ever to perfect our salvation and is never a punishment.

Each one of us is called to have the Holy Spirit abiding in us. We should use the tools God has given us–all those mentioned at the beginning–to acquire and hold onto the Grace we receive in the sacraments.
