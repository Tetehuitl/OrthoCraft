# How to Pray the Orthodox Rosary

### INTRODUCTION

What is commonly called the Rosary was known as Our Lady’s Psalter in the ancient Christian West, and is known as The Rule of the Theotokos (Mother of God) in the East. It is an Orthodox Christian devotion based on praying the Angelic Salutation (Hail Mary) 150 times. The prayer rule consists of 150 Angelic Salutations, which are divided into 15 decades. Each decade focuses on some important event in the life of the Mother of God. The Orthodox Rosary is prayed on a Prayer Rope, also called a Chotki or Comboschini. The same Prayer Rope that is used to pray the Jesus Prayer is used for this devotion. To pray the Rosary, a Prayer Rope is used in which the knots are divided into groups of ten, or decades, with a beed separating each decade.

Many people think that the Rosary originated in Roman Catholicism and that it is a Roman Catholic devotion, but that is not historically correct. “The rosary was originally an Orthodox form of prayer that was later adopted by the Roman Catholics” (1).

“The prayer rope was formed by St. Pachomius in the fourth century. From there the rosary developed, some say as early as the eighth century” (2). While the devotion originated among the monks of ancient Egypt, it was given name the Rosary by the Christians of the British Isles.

### OUR LADY’S PSALTER: THE ROSARY OR GARLAND OF ROSES

The monks of the Egyptian Thebaid were praying one hundred fifty Angelic Salutations (Hail Mary’s) grouped into fifteen decades following the pattern of the one hundred and fifty Psalms as early as the fourth century. However, while the origin of The Rule of the Theotokos, or Our Lady’s Psalter, is found in ancient Egypt, the term “Rosary” — or “garland of roses” — has its origin in the British Isles.

“It was the Western Celtic and Sarum Rites that were to develop what is today called the ‘rosary’ or ‘garland of roses.’ The Western Churches, like those of the East, had a great devotion to the Psalter of David which they divided into three parts composed of fifty psalms each. The ‘Three Fifties’ were recited for the dead and for all manner of other intentions as well by both monastics and lay-people.

“To accommodate monks and laity who could not read, little psalters were devised based on the repetition of the Lord's Prayer and the Angelical Salutation 150 times, divided into three fifties as well. Other psalters based on meditations on the life of Christ and the Most Holy Mother of God were also developed. Soon these were all fused into ‘Our Lady's Psalter’ or the ‘Rosary.’ The use of such rosaries is of a venerable age and the Western Rites of the Orthodox Church continue in its use” (3).

### SOMETIMES CALLED ST. SERAPHIM’S ROSARY

The Orthodox Rosary is sometimes called St. Seraphim’s Rosary after two great Saints of the Orthodox Church — both named St. Seraphim — who were proponents of The Rule of the Theotokos: St. Seraphim of Sarov (1754-1833) and St. Seraphim Zvezdinsky (1883-1937).

Fr. Zosima, one of the spiritual children of St. Seraphim of Sarov said, “In my hands I have a hand-written book from the cell of Saint Seraphim, containing a description of the many miracles which took place through praying to the Mother of God and especially through saying one hundred and fifty times the O Hail, Mother of God and Virgin [an Eastern Rite version of the Angelic salutation]. If, being unaccustomed to it, it is difficult to master one hundred and fifty repetitions daily, say it fifty times at first…Whomever he spoke to about this miracle-working Rule remained grateful to him.”

St. Seraphim (Zvezdinsky) was an Endoverie (Old Rite) Russian Orthodox bishop who had been consecrated to the episcopate by St. Tikhon of Moscow as Bishop of Dimitrov, and was martyred by the Soviet communists in 1937. He was tonsured a monk with the name of Seraphim after St. Seraphim of Sarov. He had great devotion to the Mother of God; and received from God the gift of preaching, becoming well known for his sermons. St. Seraphim Zvezdinsky also possessed the gifts of clairvoyance and healing of the sick; these gifts manifested themselves many times throughout his life.

Fr. Alexander Gumanovsky writes: “Bishop Seraphim Zvezdinsky performed the Rule of the Mother of God every day, and, when he performed it he prayed for the whole world, embracing in his Rule the whole life of the Queen of Heaven.”

### HOW THE ROSARY IS PRAYED

Our Lady’s Psalter — the Rosary — usually includes introductory and closing prayers. Those following the Western liturgical tradition should follow a standard form, such as opening with the Sign of the Cross, and then saying “O Lord, open thou my [our] lips. And my [our] mouth shall show forth thy praise. O God, made make speed to save me [us]. O Lord, make haste to help me [us];” followed by “Glory be to the Father…” (Gloria Patri).

Then, the appropriate Meditation is named followed by the Lord’s Prayer on the bead and ten Hail Mary’s on the knots. Fifteen decades, or at least five decades, are thus prayed, each preceded by naming the appropriate Meditation and then praying the Lord’s Prayer and ten Hail Marys. The Rosary, can then be concluded with a closing prayer such as the Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven).

### There are fifteen Meditations:

Meditation 1- The Birth of the Theotokos [Theotokos means, Mother of God]Meditation 2- The Presentation of the TheotokosMeditation 3- The Annunciation of the Lord's BirthMeditation 4- The Meeting of the Theotokos and St. ElizabethMeditation 5- The Birth of the LordMeditation 6- The Prophecy of St. SimeonMeditation 7- The Flight into EgyptMeditation 8- The Boy-Christ among the DoctorsMeditation 9- The Wedding of CanaMeditation 10- The Crucifixion of the LordMeditation 11- The Resurrection of the LordMeditation 12- The Ascension of the Lord into HeavenMeditation 13- PentecostMeditation 14- The Dormition of the Virgin TheotokosMeditation 15- The Crowning of the Theotokos by the Blessed Trinity

There are no set Meditations for certain days of the week. The Rosary can be begun on any day, with fifteen decades or five decades prayed. If five decades are prayed, then the Rosary is begun with the first Meditation, followed by the sixth Meditation the next day, and with the eleventh Meditation on the third day. Then, the Three Fifties begin again with the first Meditation.

St. Seraphim (Zvezdinsky) provides spiritual direction and beautiful prayer intentions for those praying the Rosary. Fr. Alexander Gumanovsky writes, “He [St. Seraphim Zvezdinsky] gave one of his spiritual children the task of copying a plan which included his prayer to the Ever Virgin Mary." St. Seraphim (Zvezdinsky's) spiritual directions and prayer intentions are included in this guide to praying the Rosary (4).

### PRAYING THE ROSARY

To pray the Rosary, begin by making the Sign of the Cross and saying,

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Spirit). Amen.

V. O Lord, open thou my [our] lips.

R. And my [our] mouth shall show forth thy praise.

V. O God, made make speed to save me [us].

R. O Lord, make haste to help me [us].

GLORY BE to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost (Spirit).

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end (unto all ages of ages) Amen.

Each of the Meditations may be combined with the spiritual direction and prayer intentions of St. Seraphim (Zvezdinsky) as is done here:

Pray for us to the Father, alleluia.

Let us pray.

O GOD, who by the resurrection of thy Son Jesus Christ, didst vouchsafe to give gladness unto the world: grant, we beseech thee, and we, being holpen by the Virgin Mary, His Mother, may attain unto the joys of everlasting life: through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

PRAYING THE ROSARY AS A FAMILY OR GROUP

If the Rosary is prayed as a family or group, everyone makes the Sign of the cross together. The leader says the versicles (V.) and the group says the responses (R.). The words “our” and “us” replace “my” and “me” in the opening versicles and responses.

The leader then begins the Glory Be (Gloria Patri), with the words, “Glory be to the father…,” and prays the first half of the prayer. The group follows by reciting the second half, beginning, “As it was in the beginning… Amen”

Next, the leader names the Meditation and begins the Lord’s Prayer, reciting the first half of the prayer; followed by the group which recites the second half beginning with the words, “Give us this day… Amen.”

The leader begins the Hail Mary each time it is prayed and recites the first verse; followed by the group which recites the second verse, beginning, “Blessed art thou among…” There is no need to say “Amen” after each Hail Mary.

If the longer, modern version of the Hail Mary is prayed, the leader begins the prayer and prays through the words, “of thy womb, Jesus.” The group then recites the rest of the prayer beginning with, “Holy Mary, Mother of God…”

The leader then leads in praying the Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven), saying “Let us pray” and the final Collect alone. Amen is said by the group. Then everyone makes the Sign of the Cross and the devotion is concluded.

CONCLUSION

The Rosary can be prayed as a private devotion, as a family devotion, or with a group. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

3. The Hail Mary is a combination of Biblical texts taken from Luke 1:28 and Luke 1:42, and is a prayer of praise. It is very similar to its Eastern form:

O Hail Mother of God and Virgin, Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, for thou has given birth to the Saviour of our souls. Amen.

Centuries later, the name of Jesus and a petition for Mary’s intercession were commonly added, giving us the Hail Mary as we have it today:

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

The longer version of the Hail Mary was unknown in the first millennium of Christianity, and remained unknown in the time of Thomas Aquinas as is clear from his writings. The petition "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen," was added later. This petition combined with the Hail Mary first appeared in print in AD 1495 in Girolamo Savonarola's "Esposizione sopra l’Ave Maria.” The early (shorter) version of the Hail Mary was still being used among the Irish at the beginning of the 20th century. Although the longer version of the Hail Mary is not ancient, it is perfectly Orthodox in content and is freely used by Orthodox Christians.
