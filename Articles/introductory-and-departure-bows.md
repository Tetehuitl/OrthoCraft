*These prayers are from the Old Believer Prayer Book*

When it is time for the monk to depart from his cell, or the laymen to depart from his home, he first performs the Introductory Bows, saying this:

- God be merciful to me a sinner. *With one bow to the ground*
- *Next he says:* Thou hast created me; Lord, have mercy on me. *And another bow to the ground*
- *Then he says:* I have sinned immeasurably: Lord, have mercy and forgive me, a sinner. *And another bow to the ground.*
- *Then he says:* It is truly meet: *And a great bow to the ground*
- *Then he says:* Glory: Now and ever: Lord, have mercy. *Twice*
- Lord, bless. *With three bows to the ground. (Some, however, make these bows in the ordinary manner, from the waist.)*
- *Then he says:* Through the prayers of Thy most pure Mother *and he commemorates the saint whose temple it is, or the saint of the monastery;* and of my holy [[Guardian Angel]], and of all Thy saints, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
- *But some say the Dismissal of the Beginning Bows thus:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, through the prayers of Thy most pure Mother: *and the rest, as instructed above, but the ending is said thus:* . . . . and of all Thy saints, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy and save me, for Thou art Good and lovest mankind.
