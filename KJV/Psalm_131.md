 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. ^1
 2. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. ^2
 3. Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. ^3
