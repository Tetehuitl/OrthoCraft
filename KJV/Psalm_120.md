 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. ^1
 2. Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. ^2
 3. What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? ^3
 4. Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. ^4
 5. Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! ^5
 6. My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. ^6
 7. I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. ^7
