 Book:: [[Psalm]]
 1. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. ^1
 2. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. ^2
 3. Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. ^3
 4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. ^4
