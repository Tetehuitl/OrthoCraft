*Genuine Repentance & Confession heals and makes the immortal soul holy. This is the correct way to prepare for Holy Communion: O that we can better examine the depths of our conscience, it would be ideal to first read several books on the Sacrament of Confession. Also, discuss any uncertainties that you may have with your wise spiritual father-confessor. The greatest science or knowledge is to get to know ourselves. Also, we must not deny ourselves the greatest thing that every human soul thirsts for: a peaceful conscience and eternity with God. his joy is only granted by the God-Man, our Lord Jesus Christ. He himself instituted the single path to salvation for the repentant sinner within his Church, the Holy Sacrament of Repentance and Confession. This is why, friend, you must overcome any obstacle whatsoever that blocks the road to Holy Confession. Here awaits you with genuine Christian love the good confessor, the representative of Christ, who as a fellow human being can understand and have compassion on his brethren who are also sinful. Cast far away, brethren, any thought of embarrassment or fright. Why be scared or frightened when your soul frets and pains from the deadly consequences of multi faceted sin. If sickness tortured your body, would you avoid the hospital or doctor because of embarrassment? But at the same time, do not be led astray by certain people who wish to have read on them a “blessing only” without having previously confessed. Whenever this happens from ignorance or neglect, it is a terrible sin and an insult to God. With faith then and honesty, proceed to Holy Confession. Be certain also that the infinite love of the crucified and resurrected Lord will welcome you and transform you, removing the weight that burdens YOU! He himself said, “Come to Me all ye that are heavy laden and I will grant you rest.”*
