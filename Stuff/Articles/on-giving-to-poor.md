# On Not Giving Directly to the Poor

*Saint Basil The Great*

. . .no one ought even to permit himself the distribution of his own property, but should leave it in the hands of the person entrusted with the duty of managing the affairs of the poor; and he proved the point from the acts of the apostles, because they sold their property and brought and laid it at the feet of the apostles, and by them it was distributed to each as every man had need. For he said that experience was needed in order to distinguish between cases of genuine need and of mere greedy begging. For whoever gives to the afflicted gives to the Lord, and from the Lord shall have his reward; but he who gives to every vagabond casts to a dog, a nuisance indeed from his importunity, but deserving no pity on the ground of want.

*Letter 150 (CL) Schaff, Philip. Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers Series 2, Volume 8 - Enhanced Version (Early Church Fathers) . Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Kindle Edition.*
