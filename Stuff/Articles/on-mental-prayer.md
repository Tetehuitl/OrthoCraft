*Excerpt from Unseen Warfare*

Mental or inner prayer is when a man at prayer collects his mind in the heart, and from there sends out his prayer to God, not aloud but in silent words, praising and thanking Him, confessing to Him his sins with contrition and begging for his needs in spiritual and bodily blessings. One should pray not only in words but also in mind, and not only in mind but also in the heart, so that the mind sees and understands clearly what is said in words, and the heart feels what the mind thinks. All this yoked together is real prayer, and if something of this is lacking in prayer, it is either imperfect prayer or not prayer at all. 

You are sure to have heard these expressions: prayer with words, prayer with the mind, prayer with the heart, and maybe you have heard explanations of each of them separately. What is the reason for this division of prayer into its component parts? The reason is that  owing  to  our  negligence  it  sometimes  happens  that  the  tongue  says  the  holy  words  of  prayer,  while  the  mind  wanders  away somewhere:  or  the  mind  understands  the  words  of  prayer,  but  the  heart  does  not respond  to  them  with  feeling.  In  the  first  case prayer  is  merely  words,  and  is  not  prayer  at  all;  in  the  second—prayer  with  words  is  connected  with  mental  prayer,  and  this  is imperfect, incomplete prayer. Full and real prayer is when praying words and praying thoughts are combined with praying feelings. 

There also exists, through the grace of God, prayer of the heart only, and this is spiritual prayer, which the Holy Spirit moves in the heart:  the  man  who  prays  is  conscious  of  it,  but  does  not  do  it;  it  acts  by  itself.  This  prayer  belongs  to  the  perfect.  The  form  of prayer accessible to all and demanded of all is the form where mind and feeling are always combined with the words of prayer. 

There  is  yet  another  form  of  prayer,  which  is  called  standing  in  the  presence  of  God,  when  the  man  who  prays  is  wholly concentrated  in  his  heart  and  inwardly contemplates  God  as  being  present  to  him  and  within  him,  with  corresponding  feelings—either of fear of God and the feeling of wonder and awe before His greatness, or of faith and hope, or of love and submission to His  will,  or  of  contrition  and  readiness  for  any  sacrifice.  Such  a  state  comes  when  a  man  becomes  deeply  immersed  in  prayer  by word,  mind  and  heart.  If  a  man  prays  in  the  right  way  and  for  a  long  time,  these  states  come  to  him  more  and  more  often,  and finally  this  state  can  become  permanent; then  it  is called  walking  before God  and  is constant  prayer. This  was  the state  of  David, who says of himself: ‘I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved” (Ps. xvi. 8). Thus, my brother, if you wish your prayer to bring much fruit, never be content by oral prayer alone, but pray also with your mind and heart—using your mind to understand and be conscious of all that is said in words, and your heart to feel it all. Above all, pray with your heart. Prayer bursting from the heart is like a streak of lightning, which takes but a moment to cross the heavens and appear before the throne of the all-merciful God. God hears it and inclines towards this most of all. This was the prayer with which Moses prayed  standing  before  the  Red  Sea;  and  immediately  he  heard  God’s  voice:  ‘Wherefore criest  thou  unto me?’  (Ex.  xiv.  15):  and God gave him the power to free his people from the danger which threatened them.
