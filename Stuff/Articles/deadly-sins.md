*There are sins that the Church has traditionally and canonically given a penance of excommunication for a period of time. Any sin that has one of these attached is a sin that must be confessed and properly repented of before we are allowed communion.*

*These are an incomplete list of sins that separate us from God. The Church requires us to properly confess and receive the sacrament of absolution if we have committed any of these before we may receive communion.*
