- [[Zettels]]
- The first step in the spiritual life is the renunciation of everything for the sake of God. We must relinquish our attachment to everything that is not eternal for all things are a passing vanity. Like the scripture says, "17. Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit." (Ecc 2:17)
- We must not even have attachment to our family: "10. Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat."(Mat 10:37)
- We must not even be attached to our own life: ""25. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."" (Jn 12:25)
- We must renounce the world with the right intentions or we will either, not endure temptation when it comes because we renounced the world out of fear, or we will fall to self-esteem because we renounced the world to attain glory.
- There are only two ways we will find true renunciation, the first by the desire to repent of our sins the second to acquire the Kingdom of Heaven.
