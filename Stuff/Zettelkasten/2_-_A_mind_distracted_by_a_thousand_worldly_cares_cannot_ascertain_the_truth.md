- !!Notes:
- The truth is taught to those with a pure heart by the Holy Spirit. We cannot purify our hearts if we are consumed by cares of the world. If we are distracted by a thousand thoughts a day we won't have time to do the work necessary to silence our mind in order for the Spirit to teach us.
