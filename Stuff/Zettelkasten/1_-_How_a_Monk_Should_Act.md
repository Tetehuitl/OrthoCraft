- # Notes:
- __What dawn is to some is midnight to athletes of piety. The silence of night gives leisure to their soul. No noxious sounds or sights obtrude upon their hearts. The mind is alone with itself and God, correcting itself by the recollection of its sins, giving itself precepts to help it to shun evil, and imploring aid from God for the perfecting of what it longs for.__
- Have a sorrowful and downcast eye //(from a humble and submissive spirit)//
- Neglected appearance
- Have rough hair
- Have dirty dress //(So that the appearance mourners take pains to present is our natural condition.)//
- The tunic should be fastened by a belt
- * the belt should not be above the flank like a woman's
- * The belt should not be slack, so the tunic flows loose like an idler's.
- The gait should not be sluggish nor pushing and pompous
- The clothing should be sufficient for all seasons
- Bright color should be avoided
- Soft material should be avoided
- Should should be cheap but serviceable
- The aim of dress is necessity
- The aim of food is necessity
- In good health bread and water will suffice
- Vegetables may be added for strengthening the body
- Do not eat with  an exhibition of savage gluttony 
- In everything that concerns our pleasures maintain moderation, quiet, and self-control
- Do not forget God when partaking of food and the health of our body grounds for offering him glory, thinking the various kinds of food are due to the provision of the great steward of the universe
- Before meat let grace be said for present and future gift God gives
- After meat let grace be said in gratitude for the gifts given a petition for gifts promised
- Let one hour be fixed for food, always at the same time, that out of all the hours of the day only one may be spent on the body
- The hours not spent on food should be spent in mental exercise
- Let sleep be light and easily interrupted, as naturally happens after a light diet //(It should be purposefully broken by thoughts of great themes. To be overcome by heavy torpor, with limbs unstrung, so that the way is open to wild fantasies, is to be plunged into daily death)//
