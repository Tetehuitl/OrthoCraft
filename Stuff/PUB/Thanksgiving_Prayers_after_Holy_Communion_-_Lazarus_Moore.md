Glory to Thee, O God; Glory to Thee, O God; Glory to Thee, O God.

## Anonymous

I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast not rejected me, a sinner, but hast granted me to be a communicant of Thy holy Things. I thank Thee that Thou hast granted me, unworthy as I am, to partake of Thy pure and heavenly Gifts. But, O Lord, Lover of men, Who didst die for us and rise again and bestow upon us these Thy dread and life-giving Mysteries for the wellbeing and sanctification of our souls and bodies, grant that these may be even to me for the healing of my soul and body, for the averting of everything hostile, for the enlightenment of the eyes of my heart, for the peace of the powers of my soul, for unashamed faith, for sincere love, for the fullness of wisdom, for the keeping of Thy commandments, for an increase of Thy divine grace, and for familiarity with Thy Kingdom; that being kept by Them in Thy holiness I may ever remember Thy grace, and never live for myself but for Thee our Lord and Benefactor. And so when I have passed from existence here in the hope of eternal life, may I attain to everlasting rest, where the song is unceasing of those who keep festival and the joy is boundless of those who behold the ineffable beauty of Thy face. For Thou art the true desire and the unutterable gladness of those who love Thee, O Christ our God, and all creation sings of Thee throughout the ages.

## Prayer of St. Basil the Great

Lord Christ our God, King of the ages and Creator of all, I thank Thee for all the blessings Thou hast granted me and for the communion of Thy pure and life-giving Mysteries. I pray Thee, therefore, good Lord and Lover of men, guard me under Thy protection and within the shadow of Thy wings; and grant me with a clear conscience till my last breath worthily to partake of Thy holy Things for forgiveness of sins and for life eternal. For Thou art the Bread of Life, the Source of Holiness, the Giver of all that is good, and to Thee we send up the glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

## Prayer of St. Symeon the Translator

O Thou Who givest me willingly Thy Flesh for food,\
Thou Who art fire, and burnest the unworthy,\
Scorch me not, O my Maker,\
But rather pass through me for the integration of my members,\
Into all my joints, my affections, and my heart.\
Burn up the thorns of all my sins.\
Purify my soul, sanctify my mind;\
Strengthen my knees and bones;\
Enlighten the simplicity of my five senses.\
Nail down the whole of me with Thy fear.\
Ever protect, guard, and keep me\
From every soul-destroying word and act.\
Sanctify, purify, attune, and rule me.\
Adorn me, give me understanding, and enlighten me.\
Make me the habitation of Thy Spirit alone,\
And no longer a habitation of sin,\
That as Thy house from the entry of communion\
Every evil spirit and passion may flee from me like fire.\
I offer Thee as intercessors all the sanctified,\
The Commanders of the Bodiless Hosts,\
Thy Forerunner, the wise Apostles,\
And Thy pure and immaculate Mother.\
Receive their prayers, my compassionate Christ.\
And make Thy slave a child of light.\
For Thou alone art our sanctification, O Good One,\
And the radiance of our souls,\
And to Thee as our Lord and God as is right\
We all give glory day and night.

May Thy Holy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ our God, be to me for eternal life, and Thy Precious Blood for forgiveness of sins. And may this Eucharist be to me for joy, health, and gladness. And in Thy awful second coming, make me, a sinner, worthy to stand on the right hand of Thy glory, through the intercessions of Thy holy and most pure Mother and of all Thy Saints. Amen.

## To the Most Holy Mother of God

All-holy Lady, Mother of God, the light of my darkened soul, my hope and protection, my refuge and consolation, and my joy, I thank thee that thou hast made me, who am unworthy, worthy to be a communicant of the immaculate Body and precious Blood of thy Son. But do thou who didst bear the true Light enlighten the spiritual eyes of my heart. O thou who didst conceive the Source of Immortality, give life to me who am dead in sin. O thou who art the compassionately loving Mother of the merciful God, have mercy on me and give me compunction and contrition of heart, humility in my thoughts, and the recall of my reasoning powers from their captivity. And grant me till my last breath to receive without condemnation the sanctification of the Holy Mysteries for the healing of soul and body. And give me tears of repentance and confession, and of thanksgiving, that I may praise and glorify thee all the days of my life. For thou art blessed and glorified for ever. Amen.

## Then the Song of Symeon is said:

Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, O Lord, according to Thy word. For my eyes have seen Thy salvation which Thou hast prepared in the sight of all peoples, the light of revelation for the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us. (3)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Most Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, wash away our sins, O Master, pardon our transgressions. O Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities, for Thy Name's sake.

Lord, have mercy. (3)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil one.

For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Grace like a flame shining forth from thy mouth has illumined the universe, and disclosed to the world treasures of poverty, and shown us the height of humility. And as by thy own words thou teachest us, Father John Chrysostom, so intercede with the Word, Christ our God, to save our souls.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Thou hast received divine grace from heaven, and with thy lips dost thou teach all men to adore the one God in three Persons. O John Chrysostom, most blessed Saint, we rightly praise thee; for thou art our teacher, revealing divine things.

Now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

O Unfailing Intercessor of Christians, O Constant Mediatress before the Creator, despise not the cry of prayer of us sinners but, of thy goodness, come speedily to the help of us who in faith call upon thee. Hasten to offer swift intercession and prayer (for us), O Mother of God, who ever intercedest for those who honour thee.

Lord, have mercy. (12)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

More honourable than the Cherubim, and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim, thou who in virginity didst bear God the Word, thee, true Mother of God, we magnify.
