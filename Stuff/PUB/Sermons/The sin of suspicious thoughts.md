Harboring suspicious thoughts will keep us from ever having peace. It will destroy families and communities. It makes us the play thing of the demons and a participant with them in destroying the community.

Suspicious thoughts are when we assume someone is doing something with ill intent or that they are talking about us behind our back. For example, a person may think they have seen one of their brethren with a scowl and the thought will come to them that the scowl was for them, and the person has ill feelings toward them. Or someone will overhear something said and think it was said about them. It may even be something said to you, and you take it the wrong way and ascribe ill intention to the person.

The fathers tell us that these thoughts are from the demons to put animosity between us and our brethren. One father describes a scenario like this: A demon suggested a bad thought to a brother at trapezia, and he makes a face because of the thought and another brother looks across the table and sees this brother scowling, and the demon tells this other brother that the scowl is for him. Then at another time this brother overhears the first brother saying something and the demon suggests that the brother is talking about him. This brother now adds these two incidences together and is completely convinced that his brother hates him. So, he feels justified in hating his brother back, and so he starts scowling at his brother and talking about him and the first brother overhears this and begins to have ill thoughts for his brother in return. Now both brothers cannot stand one another and think they cannot live together.

You see what a mockery the demons make out of us when we listen to suspicious thoughts, and how these thoughts can destroy a brotherhood?

The fathers tell us, even if we know for a fact our brother has something against us, we should always ascribe good intentions and even make excuses for our brother's behavior. Our brother may be misbehaving today, but tomorrow is our turn. We all wish for people to forgive us and put up with our bad behavior, but how can we expect this from our brother and not do it ourselves for our brother? This is the stupidest thought.

What defines us as Orthodox Christians is our love and compassion. This is the purpose of all the canons and councils--to become Christ. Christ received the worst sort of suspicious thoughts and undeserved hatred and even though he would be justified he never returned hatred but even sacrificed himself for those who hated him. Even though we don't have the strength to sacrifice ourselves for our brethren, let us at least not become the play things of the demons and forgive whatever slights, real or not, we may receive from them.
