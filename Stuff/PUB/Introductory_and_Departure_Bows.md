# Introductory and Departure Bows

_These prayers are from the Old Believer Prayer Book_

When it is time for the monk to depart from his cell, or the laymen to depart from his home, he first performs the Introductory Bows, saying this:

- God be merciful to me a sinner. _With one bow to the ground_

- _Next he says:_ Thou hast created me; Lord, have mercy on me. _And another bow to the ground_

- _Then he says:_ I have sinned immesurably: Lord, have mercy and forgive me, a sinner. _And another bow to the ground._

- _Then he says:_ It is truly meet: _And a great bow to the ground_

- _Then he says:_ Glory: Now and ever: Lord, have mercy. _Twice_

- Lord, bless. _With three bows to the ground. (Some, however, make these bows in the ordinary manner, from the waist.)_

- _Then he says:_ Through the prayers of Thy most pure Mother _and he commemorates the saint whose temple it is, or the saint of the monastery;_ and of my holy [[Guardian Angel]], and of all Thy saints, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

- _But some say the Dismissal of the Beginning Bows thus:_ Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, through the prayers of Thy most pure Mother: _and the rest, as instructed above, but the ending is said thus:_ . . . . and of all Thy saints, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy and save me, for Thou art Good and lovest mankind.
