The first virtue is detachment, that is, death in relation to every person or thing. This produces the desire for God, and this in turn gives rise to the anger that is in accordance with nature, and that flares up against all the tricks of the enemy. Then the fear of God will establish itself within us, and through this fear love will be made manifest. — location: [167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=167)

Say to your soul: 'If you are afraid of sinners like yourself seeing your sins, how much more should you be afraid of God who notes everything?' As a result of this warning the fear of God will be revealed in your soul, and if you cleave to Him you will not be shaken by the passions: for it is written: 'They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion: he that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be shaken' (Ps. 125:1. LXX). Whatever you are doing, remember that God sees all your thoughts, and then you will never sin. To Him be glory through all the ages. Amen. — location: [177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=177)

He who has mastery over his incensive power has mastery also over the demons. But anyone who is a slave to it is a stranger to the monastic life and to the ways of our Savior, for as David said of the Lord: 'He will teach the gentle His ways' (Ps. 25:9). The intellect of the solitary is hard for the demon to catch, for it shelters in the land of gentleness. There is scarcely any other virtue which the demons fear as much as gentleness. Moses possessed this virtue, for he was called 'very gentle, above all men' (Num. 12:3). And David showed that it makes men worthy to be remembered by God when he said: 'Lord, remember David and all his gentleness' (Ps. 132:1. LXX). And the Savior Himself also enjoined us to imitate Him in His gentleness, saying: 'Learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart: and you will find rest for your souls' (Matt. 11 :29).

The Holy Spirit, out of compassion for our weakness, comes to us even when we are impure.

We have heard that the evil one attacked a certain saint so fiercely as he prayed that, when the saint lifted up his hands, the evil one changed himself into a lion and raising his front legs fixed his claws into the saint's thighs; and he kept them there until the saint lowered his hands, which was only when he had come to the end of his usual prayers. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=768)

# [[St John Cassian]]
Bodily illness is not an obstacle to purity of heart, provided we give the body what its illness requires, not what gratifies our desire for pleasure. Food is to be taken in so far as it supports our life, but not to the extent of enslaving us to the impulses of desire. To eat moderately and reasonably is to keep the body in health, not to deprive it of holiness. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=858)

---
No one whose stomach is full can fight mentally against the demon of unchastity. Our initial struggle therefore must be to gain control of our stomach and to bring our body into subjection not only through fasting but also through vigils, labours and spiritual, reading, and through concentrating our heart on fear of Gehenna and on longing for the kingdom of heaven. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=867)

---
Bodily fasting alone is not enough to bring about perfect self-restraint and true purity; it must be accompanied by contrition of heart, intense prayer to God, frequent meditation on the Scriptures, toil and manual labour. These are able to check the restless impulses of the soul and to recall it from its shameful fantasies. Humility of soul helps more than everything else, however, and without it no one can overcome unchastity or any other sin. In the first place, then, we must take the utmost care to guard the heart from base thoughts, for, according to the Lord, 'out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, unchastity' and so on (Matt. 15:19). — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=872)

---
If we are really eager, as the Apostle puts it, to 'struggle lawfully' and to 'be crowned' (2 Tim. 2:5j for overcoming the impure spirit of unchastity, we should not trust in our own strength and ascetic practice, but in the help of our Master, God. No one ceases to be attacked by this demon until he truly believes that he will be healed and reach the heights of purity not through his own effort and labour, but through the aid and protection of God. For such a victory is beyond man's natural powers. Indeed, he who has trampled down the pleasures and provocations of the flesh is in a certain sense outside the body. Thus, no one can soar to this high and heavenly prize of holiness on his own wings and learn to imitate the angels, unless the grace of God leads him upwards from this earthly mire. — location: [880](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=880)

The commandment given by God to the first man, Adam, told him to keep watch over the head of the serpent (cf. Gen. 3:15.

While the children of Babylon - by which I mean our wicked thoughts - are still young, we should dash them to the ground and crush them against the rock, which is Christ (cf Ps. 137:9; 1 Cor. 16:4). — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=903)

# St Teodoros the Great 5326
The Fathers define prayer as a spiritual weapon. Unless we are armed with it we cannot engage in warfare, but are carried off as prisoners to the enemy's country. Nor can we acquire pure prayer unless we cleave to God with an upright heart. For it is God who gives prayer to him who prays and who teaches man spiritual knowledge. — location: [5369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=5369)

Many people wonder whether thought stimulates the passions or the passions stimulate thought. Some say the first and some the second. My own view is that thoughts are stimulated by the passions. For unless passions were in the soul, thoughts about them would not disturb it. — location: [5384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=5384)

If you love Christ you must keep the passion of rancor far from your soul. You should on no account yield to feelings of hostility: rancor lurking in the heart is like fire hidden in stalks of dry flax. Rather you should pray fervently for anyone who has grieved you, and you should help him, if you have the means. By this action your soul will be delivered from death (cf Tobit 4:10) and nothing will hinder your communion with God when you pray. — location: [5428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=5428)

Do not let anger and wrath make their home in you: for 'an angry man is not dignified' (Prov. 11 :25. LXX), whereas wisdom dwells in the hearts of the gentle.

He who keeps a serpent in his breast and he who keeps an evil thought in his heart will both be killed, the one by being bitten in the body by venomous fangs and the other by injecting a lethal poison into his soul. Let us, then, speedily slay the 'offspring of vipers' (Matt. 3:7), and let us not bring forth evil thoughts from our heart, lest we suffer bitter pangs. — location: [5450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=5450)

Do not judge the actions of your spiritual father, but obey his commands. For the demons are in the habit of showing you his defects, so that your ears may be deaf to what he tells you. They aim either to drive you from the arena as a feeble and cowardly fighter, or simply to terrify you with thoughts that undermine your faith, and so to make you sluggish about every form of virtue. — location: [5465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=5465)

the greater our longing for God the greater grows our fear; and the more we hope to attain God, the more we fear Him. If we are wounded by divine love, the sting of fear exceeds that of a thousand threats of punishment.

Do not say that you are the temple of the Lord, writes Jeremiah (cf.

In time of trial do not leave your monastery but stand up courageously against the thoughts that surge over you, especially those of irritation and listlessness.

---
We carry about with us impassioned images of the things we have experienced. If we can overcome these images we shall be indifferent to the things which they represent. For fighting against the thoughts of things is much harder than fighting against the things themselves, just as to sin in the mind is easier than to sin through outward action. — location: [6038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6038)

---
While passions such as forgetfulness and ignorance affect but one of the soul's three aspects - the incensive, the desiring or the intelligent - listlessness alone seizes control of all the soul's powers and rouses almost all the passions together. That is why this passion is more serious than all the others. Hence our Lord has given us an excellent remedy against it, saying: 'You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance' (Luke 21: 19). — location: [6045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6045)

Perfect love does not split up the single human nature, common to all, according to the diverse characteristics of individuals; but, fixing attention always on this single nature, it loves all men equally. It loves the good as friends and the bad as enemies, helping them, exercising forbearance, patiently accepting whatever they do, not taking the evil into account at all but even suffering on their behalf if the opportunity offers, so that, if possible, they too become friends. If it cannot achieve this, it does not change its own attitude; it continues to show the fruits of love to all men alike. It was on account of this that our Lord and God Jesus Christ, showing His love for us, suffered for the whole of mankind and gave to all men an equal hope of resurrection, although each man determines his own fitness for glory or punishment. — location: [6054](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6054)

Fear of God is of two kinds. The first is generated in us by the threat of punishment. It is through such fear that we develop in due order self-control, patience, hope in God and dispassion; and it is from dispassion that love comes. The second kind of fear is linked with love and constantly produces reverence in the soul, so that it does not grow indifferent to God because of the intimate communion of its love. — location: [6078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6078)

It you totally fulfill the command to love your neighbor, you will feel no bitterness or resentment against him whatever he does.

There are three things which produce love of material wealth: self-indulgence, self-esteem and lack of faith. Lack of faith is more dangerous than the other two. 18. The self-indulgent person loves wealth because it enables him to live comfortably; the person full of self-esteem loves it because through it he can gain the esteem of others: the person who lacks faith loves it because, fearful of starvation, old age, disease, or exile, he can save it and hoard it. He puts his trust in wealth rather than in God, the Creator who provides for all creation, down to the least of living things. — location: [6435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6435)

The soul has three powers: first, the power of nourishment and growth; second, that of imagination and instinct; third, that of intelligence and intellect. Plants share only in the first of these powers; animals share in the first and second; men share in all three. The first two powers are perishable; the third is clearly imperishable and immortal. — location: [6486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6486)

There are many people in the world who are poor in spirit, but not in the way that they should be: there are many who mourn, but for some financial loss or the death of their children: many are gentle, but towards unclean passions: many hunger and thirst, but only to seize what does not belong to them and to profit from injustice : many are merciful, but towards their bodies and the things that serve the body: many are pure in heart, but for the sake of self-esteem; many are peace-makers, but by making the soul submit to the flesh: many are persecuted, but as wrongdoers: many are reviled, but for shameful sins. Only those are blessed who do or suffer these things for the sake of Christ and after His example. Why? Because theirs is the kingdom of heaven, and they shall see God (cf. Matt. 5:3-12). It is not because they do or suffer these things that they are blessed, for those of whom we have spoken above do the same; it is because they do them and suffer them for the sake of Christ and after His example. — location: [6516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6516)

Just as parents have a special affection for the children who are the fruit of their own bodies, so the intellect naturally clings to its own thoughts. And just as to passionately fond parents their own children seem the most capable and most beautiful of all - though they may be quite the most ridiculous in every way - so to a foolish intellect its own thoughts appear the most intelligent of all, though they may be utterly degraded. The wise man does not regard his own thoughts in this way. It is precisely when he feels convinced that they are true and good that he most distrusts his own judgment. He makes other wise men the judges of his thoughts and arguments lest he should ran, or may have ran, in vain (cf. Gal. 2:2), and from them receives assurance. — location: [6554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=6554)

Time has three divisions. Faith is coextensive with all three, hope with one, and love with the remaining two. Moreover, faith and hope will last to a certain point; but love, united beyond union with Him who is more than infinite, will remain for all eternity, always increasing beyond all measure.

One ignorant of the spiritual path is not on his guard against impassioned conceptual images, but devotes himself entirely to the flesh.

He who believes fears; he who fears is humble; he who is humble becomes gentle and renders inactive those impulses of incensiveness and desire which are contrary to nature.

I write, not what I think - for, as Scripture says, 'men's thoughts are pathetic' (Wisd. 9:14) - but what God wills and grants by grace so that good may come of it; for 'the Lord's counsel stands for ever,' says David, 'and the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation' (Ps. 33:11). — location: [9668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=9668)

sensual concupiscent pleasure takes a great many forms. It finds satisfaction not only in unchastity and other bodily indulgences but also in every other passion. For self-restraint does not consist only in abstaining from unchastity and sexual pleasure; it also means renouncing all the other forms of indulgence too. — location: [10412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10412)

---
When the incensive power is imbued with love and deep sympathy for one's fellow men, and desire with purity and self-restraint, the intelligence is illuminated. But when dislike of one's fellow men dominates the incensive power, and desire is dissolute, the intelligence is in darkness. The intelligence is healthy, restrained and enlightened when it has the passions under control, perceives the inner essences of God's creatures spiritually, and is raised up towards the Blessed and Holy Trinity. The incensive power functions in accordance with nature when it loves all men and does not bear a grievance or harbor malice against anybody. — location: [10451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10451)

God is not interested in what happens to turn out to be good or in what appears to be good. He is interested in the purpose for which a thing is done. As the holy fathers say, when the intellect forgets the purpose of a religious observance, the outward practice of virtue loses its value. For whatever is done indiscriminately and without purpose is not only of no benefit - even though good in itself - but actually does harm. — location: [10467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10467)

---
Hence it is clear that someone who occasionally shows compassion is not compassionate, and someone who occasionally practices self-control is not self-controlled. A compassionate and self-controlled man is someone who fully, persistently, and with unfailing discrimination strives all his life for total virtue; for discrimination is greater than any other virtue; and is the queen and crown of all the virtues. The same is true of the vices: we call a man a fornicator, a drunkard or a liar not on account of a single lapse, but only when he keeps on falling into the sin in question and makes no attempt to correct himself. — location: [10472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10472)

There is something else which you must know if you really want to attain virtue and avoid sin. Just as the soul is incomparably better than the body and in many major respects altogether more excellent and precious, so the virtues of the soul are infinitely superior to the virtues of the body. This is especially true of those virtues which imitate God and bear His name. Conversely, the vices of the soul are much worse than the passions of the body, both in the actions they produce and in the punishments they incur. I do not know why, but most people overlook this fact. They treat drunkenness, unchastity, adultery, theft and all such vices with great concern, avoiding them or punishing them as something whose very appearance is loathsome to most men. But the passions of the soul are much worse and much more serious then bodily passions. For they degrade men to the level of demons and lead them, insensible as they are, to the eternal punishment reserved for all who obstinately cling to such vices. These passions of the soul are envy, rancor, malice, insensitivity, avarice - which according to the apostle is the root of all evil (cf 1 Tim. 6:10) - and all vices of a similar nature. — location: [10476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10476)

Pay strict attention to your heart and watch over it, so that it does not give admittance to thoughts that are evil or in any way vain and useless. Without interruption, whether asleep or awake, eating, drinking, or to company, let your heart inwardly and mentally at times be meditating on the psalms, at other times be repeating the prayer, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me.' And when you chant, make sure that your mouth is not saying one thing while your mind is thinking about another. — location: [10561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10561)

The only path leading to heaven is that of complete stillness, the avoidance of all evil, the acquisition of blessings, perfect love towards God and communion with Him in holiness and righteousness. If a man has attained these things he will soon ascend to the divine realm. Yet the person who aspires to this realm must first mortify his earthly aspects (cf. Col. 3:5). For when our soul rejoices in the contemplation of true goodness, it does not return to any of the passions energized by sensual or bodily pleasure; on the contrary, it turns away from all such pleasure and receives the manifestation of God With a pure and undefiled mind. — location: [10583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10583)

As a great theologian puts it, it is by practicing the virtues that we ascend to contemplation. Hence, if we neglect such practice we will be destitute of all wisdom. For even if we reach the height of virtue, ascetic effort is still needed in order to curb the disorderly impulses of the body and to keep a watch on our thoughts. — location: [10678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10678)

If you wish to be granted a mental vision of the divine you must first embrace a peaceful and quiet way of life, and devote your efforts to acquiring a knowledge of both yourself and God. If you do this and achieve a pure state untroubled by any passion, there, is nothing to prevent your intellect from perceiving, as it were in a light breeze (cf. 1 Kgs. 19:12 LXX), Him who is invisible to all: and He will bring you good tidings of salvation through a yet clearer knowledge of Himself. — location: [10739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10739)

Since salvation comes to you as a free gift, give thanks to God your Savior. If you wish to present Him with gifts, gratefully offer from your widowed soul two tiny coins, humility and love, and God will accept these in the treasury of His salvation more gladly than the host of virtues deposited there by others (cf. Mark 12:41-43). Dead through the passions, pray like Lazarus to be brought to life again, sending to God these two sisters to intercede with Him (cf. John 11:20-44): and you will surely attain your goal. — location: [10883](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10883)

The practice of the virtues does not by itself bring you to the dispassion that enables you to pray undistracted and in purity: spiritual contemplation must also in its turn confer on your intellect illuminative knowledge and the understanding of created beings. Thus winged and enlightened, the intellect is totally rapt by the love of true prayer and raised up to the cognate light of the incorporeal orders; thence, in so far as this is possible, it is borne towards the ultimate light, the triple sun of the Trinity supremely divine. — location: [10887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10887)

Salvation is attained through simplicity and virtue, not through the glories of the priesthood, which demands of us an angelic way of life. Either, then, you should become dispassionate like the angels, in thought and purpose superior to the world and the flesh, climbing the ladder to heaven in this way; or else, aware of your weakness, you should in fear avoid the high rank of the priesthood, terrified of the great fall should you prove unworthy of it. Choose the form of life followed by the laity, for it brings one no less close to God than priesthood. Moreover, should you fall while pursuing it, through God's mercy and grace you will easily rise again by repenting. — location: [10931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=10931)

As the sun excels the stars so do the worship, propitiation and invocation of the priest excel all psalmody and prayer. For we priests sacrifice, set forth and offer in intercession the Only -Begotten Himself who in His freely-given compassion was slain on behalf of sinners. And, provided that our consciences are not polluted, we receive thereby not only remission of sins, but all the things for which we pray and which are for our benefit. What is united to the Divinity burns the brushwood of sin like coal and illumines the hearts of those who approach in faith. Similarly, the divine and precious blood cleanses and purifies more than any hyssop every stain and defilement in those who dare to receive it with all the purity and holiness of which they are capable. — location: [11000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11000)

5. Nothing is more unsettling than talkativeness and more pernicious than an unbridled tongue, disruptive as it is of the soul's proper state. For the soul's chatter destroys what we build each day and scatters what we have laboriously gathered together. What is more disastrous than this 'uncontrollable evil' (Jas. 3:8)? The tongue has to be restrained, checked by force and muzzled, so to speak, and made to serve only what is needful. Who can describe all the damage that the tongue does to the soul? — location: [11061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11061)

9. We ought to make ourselves each day such as we should be when we are to appear before God. For the. prophet Hosea says: 'Hold fast to mercy and judgment, and always draw close to your God' (Hos. 12:6. LXX). Again, Malachi, speaking in God's name, says: 'A son honors his father, and a servant his lord. If I am a father, where is the honor due to me? And if I am Lord, where is the fear? So says the Lord Almighty' (Mai. 1:6. LXX). And St Paul states: 'Let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1). And again. Wisdom says: 'Guard your heart with all diligence, for on this depends the outcome of life' (Prov. 4:23). And our Lord Jesus Christ said: 'Cleanse first the inside of the cup, so that the outside may also be clean' (Matt. 23:26). — location: [11084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11084)

For, as St Paul says (cf. 1 Cor. 4:6, 18, 19; 8:1), souls that gather knowledge from here and there tend to become haughty and disdainful towards their inferiors, as they regard them; they lack the spark of the love which builds up. But he who all the day long is mindful of death discerns the assaults of the demons more keenly; and he counterattacks and repels them. — location: [11183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11183)

25. You must direct your wrath only against the demons, for they wage war upon us through our thoughts and are full of anger against us. As regards the manner of the hourly warfare within us, listen and act accordingly. Combine prayer with inner watchfulness, for watchfulness purifies prayer, while prayer purifies watchfulness. It is through unceasing watchfulness that we can perceive what is entering into us and can to some extent close the door against it, calling upon our Lord Jesus Christ to repel our malevolent adversaries. Attentiveness obstructs the demons by rebutting them; and Jesus, when invoked, disperses them together with all their fantasies. — location: [11202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11202)

29. Smoke from wood kindling a fire troubles the eyes; but then the fire gives them light and gladdens them. Similarly, unceasing attentiveness is irksome; but when, invoked in prayer, Jesus draws near. He illumines the heart; for remembrance of Him confers on us spiritual enlightenment and the highest of all blessings. — location: [11227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=11227)

For if he thinks he is repentant and nevertheless attempts to refute the person who - rightly or wrongly - is judging him, he is not worthy of the grace of forgiveness, since he acts as if he seeks a hearing in court and the opportunity to justify himself, hoping to achieve what he wants through a due process of law. — location: [13911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=13911)

11. If the world and everything in it passes away, while God alone is eternal and immortal, then rejoice, since for His sake you have renounced what is corruptible. Not merely wealth and possessions, but every sensual pleasure and sinful enjoyment are corruptive. Only the commandments of God are light and life, and everyone acknowledges them as such. — location: [16569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16569)

12. If, brother, consumed by spiritual ardor you have entered a monastery or placed yourself under a spiritual father, do not indulge in baths, food or other bodily consolations, even if urged to do so by your spiritual father himself or by your monastic brethren. On the contrary, always be ready to fast, to endure hardship, to exercise the utmost self-control. If, however, your spiritual father insists that you should enjoy some comfort, you will obey him, not even in such a case acting according to your own will. But if he does not insist, then gladly endure what you have freely chosen to do, and your soul will benefit. By keeping to this rule, you will find that always, in every situation, you are abstinent and self-controlled, prompt to renounce your own will in all things. Moreover, you will keep alight in your heart that flame which constrains you to stand aloof from everything. — location: [16572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16572)

21. The spiritual contestant must not only abstain from evil actions, but must also strive to be free from hostile thoughts and notions.

25. The person who sees with physical eyes knows when it is night and when it is day; the blind man is unaware of both. The person who has come to see with the eyes of the spirit, and who has beheld the true and quenchless light, is consciously aware when he is deprived of it should he return, out of laziness, to his former blindness; and he will not be ignorant of why this has happened. But the person blind from birth, and remaining so, knows nothing of these things from personal experience of their operation. He knows about them only from hearsay, but has never actually seen them; and if he tells others what he has heard, neither he nor his audience will know what he is talking about. — location: [16613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16613)

26. We cannot both sate ourselves with food and spiritually enjoy divine and nominal blessings; the more we pander to the stomach the less can we experience such enjoyment.

31. A person who suffers bitterly when slighted or insulted should recognize from this that he still harbors the ancient serpent in his breast. If he quietly endures the insult or responds with great humility, he weakens the serpent and lessens its hold. But if he replies acrimoniously or brazenly, he gives it strength to pour its venom into his heart and to feed mercilessly on his guts. In this way the serpent becomes increasingly powerful; it destroys his soul's strength and his attempts to set himself right, compelling him to live for sin and to be completely dead to righteousness. — location: [16630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16630)

32. If you want to renounce the world and to be instructed in life according to the Gospels, do not place yourself in the hands of an inexperienced master or one subject to the passions; for then you will be taught, not the ways of the Gospels, but those of the devil. Good masters impart good teaching, but the evil teach evil. Bad seed produces rotten fruit. — location: [16634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16634)

46. Contrition of heart, when excessive and untimely, troubles and darkens the mind, destroying the soul's humility and pure prayer, and paining the heart. This induces a hardening to the point of total insensibility; and by means of this the demons reduce spiritual people to despair. — location: [16677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16677)

---
48. The only thing God requires of us is that we do not sin. But this is achieved, not by acting according to the law, but by carefully guarding the divine image in us and our supernal dignity. When we thus live in our natural state, wearing the resplendent robe of the Spirit, we dwell in God and God dwells in us. Then we are called gods by adoption and sons of God, sealed by the light of the knowledge of God (cf Ps. 4:6. LXX). — location: [16690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16690)

51. Whoever fears the Lord will not fear the sickly attacks of demons or the threats of evil people. Like a flame or a burning fire, he goes about day and night through dark and hidden places, and instead of fleeing from the demons he makes them flee from him, so as not to be scorched by the flaming rays of divine fire that pour from him. — location: [16702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16702)

---
53. Not only the hesychast, living alone, or the monk under obedience, but also the abbot, the spiritual director of many, and even a monk charged with specific duties, need to be detached and completely free from all worldly cares. For if we are not detached, we transgress the commandment of God which says, 'Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, or what you will wear; for it is the heathen who worry about all these things' (Matt. 6:25, 32). And again, 'Take care that your heart is not weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness and worldly cares' (Luke 21:34). — location: [16708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16708)

54. A person full of anxiety about worldly things is not free: he is dominated and enslaved by this anxiety, whether it is about himself or about others. But he who is free from such things is untroubled by worldly concerns, whether they relate to himself or to others; and this is so, even if he is a bishop, abbot or priest. However, he will not be idle, or neglect even the most insignificant and trivial details; but all he does he will do for the glory of God, accomplishing everything in his life without anxiety. — location: [16712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16712)

55. Do not pull down your own house because you want to build a house for your neighbor. Think how exhausting and difficult the task will be.

60. Many read the Holy Scriptures and hear them read. But few can grasp their meaning and import. For some what is said in the Scriptures is impossible, for others it is altogether beyond belief. Some again interpret them wrongly: they apply things said about the present to the future, and things said about the future to the past or else to what happens daily. In this way they reveal a lack of true judgment and discernment in things both human and divine. — location: [16736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16736)

---
61. We, the faithful, should look upon all the faithful as one single being, and should consider that Christ dwells in each of them. We should have such love for each of them that we are willing to lay down our lives for him. Nor should we ever think or say that anyone is evil: we should look on everyone as good, as I have already said. Even should you see someone overwhelmed by some passion, execrate, not him, but the passions that fight against him. And if he is mastered by desires and prepossessions, have even greater compassion for him; for you too may be tempted, subject as you are to the same fluctuations of beguiling materiality. — location: [16739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16739)

70. Those who simulate virtue and who, because of the sheepskin of the monastic habit, appear to be one thing outwardly but are something else inwardly - steeped perhaps in iniquity, jealousy, ambition, and foul pleasures - are revered by most people as saintly and dispassionate; for in most people the soul's eye is unpurified, and so they cannot recognize these impostors by their fruits (cf Matt. 7:15-16). Those, on the other hand, who are full of devoutness, virtue and simplicity of heart, and who are truly saints, are judged by most people to be like other men; and they pass them by with disdain, counting them as nothing. — location: [16778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16778)

---
72. The arrogant, sick with diabolic pride, reject anyone inspired by the Holy Spirit as if this saintly man were himself arrogant and filled with pride; for his words strike them like blows, yet do not move them to compunction. But whoever uses his inborn talents or education to spin long phrases, and who tells lies to people about their salvation, is welcomed by them and praised to the skies; and so no one among them is able to see the situation as it is and judge it accordingly. — location: [16784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16784)

---
74. Through holy baptism we are granted remission of our sins, are freed from the ancient curse, and are sanctified by the presence of the Holy Spirit. But we do not as yet receive the perfection of grace, as described in the words of Scripture, 'I will dwell in them, and move in them' (2 Cor. 6:16); for that is true only of those who are steadfast in faith and have demonstrated this through what they do. If after we have been baptized we gravitate towards evil and foul actions, we lose the sanctification of baptism completely. But through repentance, confession and tears we receive a corresponding remission of our former sins and, in this way, sanctification accompanied by the grace of God. — location: [16792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16792)

88. Many have called the eremitic life blessed, others, the communal or coenobitic life. Others again have described in this way leadership of the faithful, or the counseling, teaching and administration of churches. All of these are activities that provide people with nourishment in body and soul. But for my part I would not judge any one of them to be better than the others, nor would I say that one merits praise and another censure. But in every case, whatever our work or activity, it is the life led for God and according to God that is most blessed. — location: [16849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16849)

---
102. A soul not consciously and completely free from ties and attachments to the visible world is not able to endure serenely the calamities and ravages with which both men and demons assail it. Bound by its attachment to human concerns, it is lacerated by the loss of material things, suffers when deprived of possessions, and is full of distress when its body is afflicted. — location: [16903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16903)

---
103. A person who has delivered his soul from its ties with and desires for sensible things, and has bound it to God, will not only scorn property and possessions, accepting their loss painlessly, as if they belonged to others and were not his own; he will also endure bodily distress with joy and gratitude. In the words of St Paul, he sees the outward self perishing, but the inward self being renewed day by day (cf. 2 Cor. 4: 16). Otherwise it is impossible joyfully to bear the afflictions permitted by God, for this requires perfect knowledge and spiritual wisdom. He who lacks these things walks at all times in the darkness of ignorance and hopelessness, totally incapable of beholding the light of patience and benediction. — location: [16906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16906)

---
104. Anyone who thinks himself intelligent because of his scholarly or scientific learning will never be granted insight into divine mysteries unless he first humbles himself and becomes a fool (cf 1 Cor. 3:18), discarding both his presumption and the knowledge that he has acquired. But if he does this and with unhesitating faith allows himself to be led by those wise in divine matters, he will enter with them into the city of the living God. Guided and illumined by the divine Spirit, he will see and learn what others cannot ever see or learn. He will then be taught by God (cf. John 6:45). — location: [16911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16911)

---
105. Those taught by God will be regarded as fools by the disciples of such as are wise in the wisdom of this world. But in fact it is the worldly-wise that are fools, spouting an inane secular wisdom, the stupidity of which God has demonstrated (cf. 1 Cor. 1:20) and which Scripture condemns as material, unspiritual, devilish, filled with strife and malice (cf. Jas. 3:15). Since these people are blind to the divine light, they cannot see the marvels it contains; they regard as deluded those who dwell in that light and see and teach others about what is within it. On the contrary, it is they themselves that are deluded, not having tasted the ineffable blessings of God. — location: [16915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16915)

---
109. Baptism does not take away our free will or freedom of choice, but gives us the freedom no longer to be tyrannized by the devil unless we choose to be. After baptism it is in our power either to persist willingly in the practice of the commandments of Christ, into whom we were baptized, and to advance in the path of His ordinances, or to deviate from this straight way and to fall again into the hands of our enemy, the devil. — location: [16938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=16938)

---
122. Each day you should reveal all your thoughts to your spiritual father; and you should accept with complete confidence what he says to you, as if it came from the mouth of God. Do not speak of any of this to anyone else, saying: 'When I asked my spiritual father such and such a thing, he said this or that; was that good counsel or not? And what should I do to heal myself?' Words like these display lack of trust in your spiritual father and injure the soul. Mostly they occur in the case of beginners. — location: [17002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17002)

---
123. You should look on all who are in the monastery as saints and regard only yourself as a sinner and as the least of all, thinking that on that day all will be saved and you alone will be punished. And when you are in church reflecting about these things, weep bitter tears of compunction, taking no account of those who will be shocked by this or mock such behavior. But if you see that as a result of this you are slipping into self-esteem, leave the church and weep in secret, returning as soon as you can to your place. This is particularly valuable in the case of beginners, especially during the six psalms, the Psalter, the readings, and the Divine Liturgy. Be careful not to condemn anyone, but keep it in mind that all who see your distress will think that you are a great sinner and will pray for your salvation. If you think of this at all times and carry it out constantly, you will be greatly helped, attracting to yourself God's grace and becoming a participant in His divine blessings. — location: [17005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17005)

140. You should always direct your intellect towards God, whether asleep or awake, eating or talking, engaged in your handiwork Or in any other activity. Thus you will fulfill the saying of the prophet, 'I have set the Lord always before me' (Ps. 16:8). Reckon yourself a greater sinner than anyone else. For if you persist in this state of recollectedness, illumination will enter your mind like a ray of light. And the more you aspire to such illumination, attentive and undistracted, striving and tearful, the more clearly it will shine. When it shines, it is loved; and when it is loved, it purifies; and as it purifies, it makes one godlike, enlightening one and teaching one to distinguish good from evil. But, my brother, much hard work is needed, and God's help, before this radiance indwells totally in your soul and illumines it as the moon illumines the darkness of the night. You must also pay attention to the thoughts of arrogance and presumption which attack you, and not condemn anyone when you see him doing something wrong. For when the demons see the soul freed from passions and temptations through the indwelling of grace and the resulting state of peace, they attack it through such thoughts. But help comes from God. Let your inward grief be continuous and your tears unquenchable. Yet take care not to harm yourself because of your great joy and compunction: recognize that they are the result not of your own labor but of God's grace. Otherwise they may be taken from you and, when you urgently seek them again in prayer, you will not be able to recover them. You will then know what a gift it is that you have lost. May we never, Lord, be deprived of Thy grace. — location: [17065](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17065)

Ascetic toil is initially painful for all those newly engaged in spiritual warfare; but for those exercised in the growth of virtue and who have reached the mid-point of their path, such toil is pleasurable and produces a strange sense of relief. — location: [17469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17469)

---
28. Deep-rooted faith is pre-eminent among the virtues, since such faith strips the soul of doubt and rids it completely of self-love. For nothing so prevents someone newly engaged in spiritual warfare from practicing the commandments as this pernicious vice of self-love. It even prevents the progress of those well advanced on the spiritual path, for it suggests illnesses to them and malignant bodily ailments, so that their ardor wanes and they are persuaded to give up ascetic toil on the grounds that in their susceptible state it is dangerous. Self-love is inane amity for the body, which ends by making the monk a lover of himself - of his own soul and body - and so estranges him from God and from God's kingdom, in accordance with the gospel phrase, 'He who loves his life will destroy it' (John 12:25). — location: [17489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17489)

30. Nothing, I think, so promotes the soul's swift progress as faith - not just faith in God and in His only -begotten Son, but faith that is deeply rooted. With this faith we believe in the truth of Christ's promises, made and kept in readiness for those who love Him (cf. 1 Cor. 2:19), just as we also believe in the truth of the threats and the infernal punishments prepared for the devil and his accomplices (cf. Matt. 25:41). This faith inspires the striving soul with the hope that it will attain the state of the saints, their blessed dispassion, climbing the heights of their holiness and becoming a coheir with them of God's kingdom. With such assurance the soul assiduously and unwaveringly augments its practice of the commandments, imitating the labors of the saints and pursuing their perfection by means of similar struggles. — location: [17499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17499)

36. In the eyes of God and of those who have a Christ-like life, to act with passion because of one's dissolute character and to take pride in one's virtues through a spirit of self-conceit are each as evil as the other. In the first case it is shameful even to speak of the things that those enslaved to the passions do in secret (cf Eph. 5:12); in the second case the self -vaunting of the heart is an abomination to God. The dissolute person alienates himself from God, for he is 'flesh' (cf Gen. 6:3), while the person who takes pride in his virtue is unclean in God's sight because of his self-conceit. — location: [17529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17529)

37. A passion is not the same thing as a sinful act: they are quite distinct. A passion operates in the soul, a sinful act involves the body. For example, love of pleasure, avarice and love of praise are three particularly noxious passions of the soul; but unchastity, greed and wrong-doing are sinful acts of the flesh. Lust anger and arrogance are passions of the soul produced when the soul's powers operate in a way that is contrary to nature. Adultery, murder, theft, drunkenness and whatever else is done through the body, are sinful and noxious actions of the flesh. — location: [17533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17533)

56. Those newly embarked on the ascetic life are assisted in the practice of the commandments and in their escape from evil by fear of punishment. But in those who through virtue have advanced to the contemplation of God's glory this fear is followed by another fear - a pure fear (cf Ps. 19:9) - which, because it is caused by love, fills them with great dread. This helps them to stand unshaken in their love for God, instilling in them terror at falling away from such love. If beginners in spiritual warfare lapse, but then repent and recover, they are filled once more with the first fear, accompanied now by auspicious hope. But when those who have attained the heights of contemplation fall from them as a result of the devil's malice, they do not at once recover the second kind of fear. A grey mist and a palpable darkness (cf Exod. 10:21) envelop them, and they are filled with despondency, pain and bitterness, together with their earlier fear of punishment. And if the Lord of hosts did not curtail those days of unbearable pain, none who fall from the heights of contemplation would be rescued (cf. Matt. 24:22). — location: [17608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17608)

58. 'I have seen under the sun', remarked the sage (cf. Eccles. 1:3; 9:11), 'a man who thought he was intelligent, who though mortal presumed on his own works and had a high opinion of his own human, worldly and psychic wisdom. Because of this not only did he look down on simple men, but he ridiculed the divinely-appointed Christian teachers and mocked them on account of their peculiar form of speech, their deliberate eschewing of the polished diction of academics, and the lack of rhythmical dexterity in their writings. To such a man, ignorant that God prefers clarity of thought to well-turned phrases or sonorous words, I would commend the maxims: 'Better a living dog than a dead lion' (Eccles. 9:4), and 'Better a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who no longer knows how to pay attention' ' (Eccles. 4:13. LXX). — location: [17619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17619)

Love for God begins with detachment from things human and visible. Purification of heart and intellect marks the intermediate stage, for through such purification the eye of the intellect is spiritually unveiled and we attain knowledge of the kingdom of heaven hidden within us (cf. Luke 17:21). The final stage is consummated in an irrepressible longing for the supernatural gifts of God and in a natural desire for union with God and for finding one's abode in Him. — location: [17832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17832)

The carnal mode of life is one wholly devoted to the pleasures and enjoyments of this present life, and has nothing to do with the psychic and spiritual modes of life, and does not even have any wish to acquire them. The psychic mode, which is situated on the borderline between evil and virtue, is preoccupied with the care and strengthening of the body and with men's praise; it not only repudiates the labors required for virtue, but also rejects carnal indulgence. It avoids both virtue and vice but for opposite reasons: virtue because this requires toil and discipline; vice because that would entail forfeiting men's praise. The spiritual mode of life, on the other hand, has nothing in common with these two other modes, and on this account is not implicated in the evil that pertains to either: it is entirely free in every way from both the one and the other. Invested with the wings of love and dispassion, it soars above them both, doing nothing that is forbidden and not being hamstrung by evil. — location: [17839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17839)

Those engaged in spiritual warfare can escape from the cycle of trial and temptation only by recognizing their weakness, and regarding themselves as strangers to righteousness and unworthy of any solace, honor, or repose. God, the doctor of our souls, wishes us to be always humble and modest, detached from our fellow-men and imitators of His sufferings. For He was 'gentle and humble in heart' (Matt. 11:29), and wants us to pursue the path of His commandments with a similar gentleness and humility of heart. — location: [17945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17945)

Humility is not achieved by means of a scraggy neck, squalid hair, or filthy, ragged and unkempt clothing, to which the generality of men ascribe the sum total of this virtue. It comes from a contrite heart and a spirit of self-abasement. As David said, 'God will not scorn a contrite spirit, and a contrite and humble heart' (cf. Ps. 51:19. LXX). — location: [17949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17949)

Truth is not evinced by looks, gestures or words, and God reposes not in these things but in a contrite heart, a humble spirit and a soul illumined by the knowledge of God. Sometimes we see someone speaking to all comers in an outwardly obsequious and humble manner, while inwardly he pursues the praise of men and is filled with self-conceit, guile, malice and rancor. And there are times when we see someone fighting for righteousness outwardly with lofty words of wisdom, taking a stand against falsehood or the transgression of God's laws, and looking only to the truth, while within he is all modesty, humility, and love for his fellow-men. Sometimes also we see such a person glorying in the Lord after the manner of St Paul, who when he gloried in the Lord said, 'I will glory in my infirmities' (2 Cor. 12:9). — location: [17977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=17977)

'Know thyself: this is true humility, the humility that teaches us to be inwardly humble and makes our heart contrite. Such humility you must cultivate and guard.

If you are not called by God to a high status, never try to attain it through money or human support or by demanding it, even if you know you can help others. For if you do, three things lie in wait for you, and of them one will surely happen: either God's anger and wrath will fall upon you in the form of diverse assaults and misfortunes - for not only men but virtually the whole of creation will turn on you, and your life will be full of anguish; or your enemies will gain the upper hand and expel you from your position in deep disgrace; or you will die before your time, cut off from this present life. — location: [18107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18107)

Scripture enumerates seven gifts of the Spirit, beginning with wisdom and ending with the divine fear of the Spirit; for it speaks of 'the spirit of wisdom, the spirit of understanding, the spirit of counseling, the spirit of strength, the spirit of divine knowledge, the spirit of reverence, the spirit of the fear of God' (cf. Isa. 11:2). But we for our part should begin with the fear that purifies - that is to say, with the fear of punishment; in this way, first repudiating evil and through repentance expunging the squalor of sin, we may attain the pure fear of the Spirit. Having once attained it, we may lay aside all our struggles for virtue. — location: [18277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18277)

Only in ignorance would one claim that man is created in the image of God with respect to the organic structure of his body. He is in the image by virtue of the spiritual nature of his intellect, which is not circumscribed by the dead weight of the body. Since the divine nature is outside every created being and all material grossness, it is not circumscribed, but is unlimited and incorporeal, beyond substance and all condition, without qualities, impalpable, unquantifiable, invisible, immortal, incomprehensible and totally beyond our grasp. Similarly, the spiritual nature given to us by God is uncircumscribed and outside the material grossness of this world, and so is incorporeal, invisible, impalpable, incomprehensible, and an image of His immortal and eternal glory. — location: [18382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18382)

So long as the nature of the powers within us is in a state of inner discord and is dispersed among many contrary things, we do not participate in God's supernatural gifts. And if we do not participate in these gifts, we are also far from the mystical Eucharist of the heavenly sanctuary, celebrated by the intellect through its spiritual activity. When through assiduous ascetic labor we have purged ourselves of the crudity of evil and have reconciled our inner discord through the power of the Spirit, we then participate in the ineffable blessings of God, and worthily concelebrate the divine mysteries of the intellect's mystical Eucharist with God the Logos in His supracelestial and spiritual sanctuary; for we have become initiates and priests of His immortal mysteries. — location: [18455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18455)

There are three stages on the spiritual path: the purgative, the illuminative and finally the mystical, through which we are perfected. The first pertains to beginners, the second to those in the intermediate stage, and the third to the perfect. It is through these three consecutive stages that we ascend, growing in stature according to Christ and attaining 'mature manhood, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'(Eph. 4:13). — location: [18568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18568)

The purgative stage pertains to those newly engaged in spiritual warfare. It is characterized by the rejection of the materialistic self, liberation from material evil, and investiture with the regenerate self, renewed by the Holy Spirit (cf. Col. 3:10). It involves hatred of materiality, the attenuation of the flesh, the avoidance of whatever incites the mind to passion, repentance for sins committed, the dissolving with tears of the bitter sediment left by sin, the regulation of our life according to the generosity of the Spirit, and the cleansing through compunction of the inside of the cup (cf Matt. 23:26) - the intellect - from every defilement of flesh and spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 7:1), so that it can then be filled with the wine of the Logos that gladdens the heart of the purified (cf. Ps. 104:15), and can be brought to the King of the celestial powers for Him to taste. Its final goal is that we should be forged in the fire of ascetic struggle, scouring off the rust of sin, and steeled and tempered in the water of compunction, so that sword-like we may effectively cut off the passions and the demons. Reaching this point through long ascetic struggle, we quench the fire within us, muzzle the brute-like passions, become strong in the Spirit instead of weak (cf. Heb. 11:33-34), and like another Job conquer the tempter through our patient endurance. — location: [18572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18572)

Since the day of judgment will be one of fire, what each of us has done, as St Paul says, will be tested by fire (cf . 1 Cor. 3:13). Thus, if what we have built up is of an incorruptible nature, it will not be destroyed by fire; and not only will it not be consumed, but it will be made radiant, totally purified of whatever small amount of filth may adhere to it. But if the work with which we have burdened ourselves consists of corruptible matter, it will be consumed and burnt up and we will be left destitute in the midst of the fire (cf 1 Cor. 3:13-15). Incorruptible and imperishable actions are the following: tears of repentance, acts of charity, compassion, prayer, humility, faith, hope, love and whatever else is done in a spirit of devotion. Even while we are still alive such actions help to build us up into a holy temple of God (cf. Eph. 2:21-22), while when we die they accompany us and remain incorruptibly with us for ever. The actions which are consumed by the fire are well known to all: self-indulgence, vainglory, avarice, hatred, envy, theft, drunkenness, abusiveness, censoriousness, and anything else of a base nature to which our appetites or incensive power prompts us to give bodily expression. Such actions pollute us even while we are still living and consumed by the fire of desire; and when we are wrenched away from the body, they accompany us but do not survive. On the contrary, they are destroyed and leave their perpetrator in the midst of the fire, to be punished immortally for all eternity. — location: [18827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18827)

Is the kingdom of heaven already given in this life to all those advanced on the spiritual way, or is it given to them after the dissolution of the body? If in this life, our victory is unassailable, our joy inexpressible, and our path to paradise unimpeded: we are directly present in the divine East (cf. Gen. 2:8). But if it is given only after death and dissolution, we should ask that our departure from this life may take place without fear; we should learn what the kingdom of heaven is, what the kingdom of God is, and what paradise is, and how the one differs from the other; also what the nature of time is in each of them, and whether we enter all three, and how and when and after how much time.

The nine heavenly powers sing hymns of praise that have a threefold structure, as they stand in threefold rank before the Trinity, in awe celebrating their liturgy and glorifying God. Those who come first - immediately below Him who is the Source and Cause of all things and from whom they take their origin - are the initiators of the hymns and are named thrones. Cherubim and Seraphim. They are characterized by a fiery wisdom and a knowledge of heavenly things, and their supreme accomplishment is the godly hymn of El, as the Divinity is called in Hebrew. Those in the middle rank, encircling God between the first triad and the last, are the authorities, dominions and powers. They are characterized by their ordering of great events, their performance of wondrous deeds and working of miracles, and their supreme accomplishment is the Trisagion: Holy, Holy, Holy (cf Isa. 6:3; Rev. 4:8). Those nearest to us, superior to us but below the more exalted ranks, are the principalities, archangels and angels. They are characterized by their ministrative function, and their supreme accomplishment is the sacred hymn Alleluia (cf. Rev. 19:1). When our intelligence is perfected through the practice of the virtues and is elevated through the knowledge and wisdom of the Spirit and by the divine fire, it is assimilated to these heavenly powers through the gifts of God, as by virtue of its purity it draws towards itself the particular characteristic of each of them. We are assimilated to the third rank through the ministration and performance of God's commandments. We are assimilated to the second rank through our compassion and solidarity with our fellow-men, as well as through our ordering of matters great and divine, and through the activities of the Spirit. We are assimilated to the first rank through the fiery wisdom of the Logos and through knowledge of divine and human affairs. Perfected in this way, and rewarded with the gifts that belong by nature to the heavenly powers, our intelligence is united through them with the God of the Decad, for it offers to Him from its own being the finest of all the offerings that can be made by the tenth rank. — location: [18946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=18946)

Prayer is the mind's dialogue with God, in which words of petition are uttered with the intellect riveted wholly on God.

Repulse evil thoughts and do not let than penetrate the heart and settle there; for when passion-imbued thoughts persist they bring the passions themselves to life and are the death of the intellect. As soon as you sense that they are attacking you, try to destroy them with the arrow of prayer. If they go on importuning you to be let in, confusing your mind, now withdrawing, now assailing you again, you may be sure that a preferment desire for them on your part is giving them strength. Because the soul's free will has been overcome in this way, they now have a lawful claim against it, and so they perturb and pester it. Hence you should expose them through confession, for evil thoughts take to flight as soon as they are denounced. Just as darkness recedes when light shines, so the light of confession dispels the darkness of impassioned thoughts. The vanity and self-indulgence that provided an opening for such thoughts are destroyed by the shame felt in confessing them and by the hardship of the penance imposed. Evil thoughts See in confusion when they find the mind already free from passions as a result of continuous, truly contrite prayer. — location: [19139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=19139)

Only those who through their purity have become saints are spiritually intelligent in the way that is natural to man in his pre-fallen state.

The materialistic and wordy spirit of the wisdom of this world may lead us to speak about ever wider spheres of knowledge, but it renders our thoughts increasingly crude and uncouth.

Strictly speaking the soul possesses these various forms of teachings within itself as part of its own life; but when it learns about them through listening to others it becomes conscious of them, provided it listens with faith and provided the teacher teaches with love, speaking of the virtues without vanity or self-esteem. Then the soul is disciplined by instruction, nourished by reading, graciously escorted to her wedding by the deeply -rooted teaching that derives from ascetic practice, and receives the illuminative teaching of the Holy Spirit as a bridegroom who unites her to Himself and fills her with delight. 'Every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God' (Matt. 4:4) denotes the words that, inspired by the Holy Spirit, issue from the mouths of the saints - an inspiration granted not to all but only to those who are worthy. For although all intelligent beings take pleasure in knowledge, very few are those in this world who are consciously filled with joy by the wisdom of the Spirit; most of us only know and participate through the power of memory in the images and reflections of spiritual wisdom, for we do not yet with full awareness partake of the Logos of God, the true celestial bread. But in the life to come this bread is the sole food of me saints, proffered in such abundance that it is never exhausted, depleted, or immolated anew. — location: [19783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=19783)

He who practices hesychasm must acquire the following five virtues, as a foundation on which to build: silence, self-control, vigilance, humility and patience. Then there are three practices blessed by God: psalmody, prayer and reading - and handiwork for those weak in body. These virtues which we have listed not only embrace all the rest but also consolidate each other. From early morning the hesychast must devote himself to the remembrance of God through prayer and stillness of heart, praying diligently in the first hour, reading in the second, chanting psalms in the third, praying in the fourth, reading in the fifth, chanting psalms in the sixth, praying in the seventh, reading in the eighth, chanting psalms in the ninth, eating in the tenth, sleeping in the eleventh, if need be, and reciting vespers in the twelfth hour.

For beginners prayer is like a joyous fire kindled in the heart; for the perfect it is like a vigorous sweet-scented light. Or again, prayer is the preaching of the Apostles, an action of faith or, rather, faith itself, 'that makes real for us the things for which we hope' (Heb. 11:1), active love, angelic impulse, the power of the bodiless spirits, their work and delight, the Gospel of God, the heart's assurance, hope of salvation, a sign of purity, a token of holiness, knowledge of God, baptism made manifest, purification in the water of regeneration, a pledge of the Holy Spirit, the exultation of Jesus, the soul's delight, God's mercy, a sign of reconciliation, the seal of Christ, a ray of the noetic sun, the heart's dawn-star, the confirmation of the Christian faith, the disclosure of reconciliation with God, God's grace, God's wisdom or, rather, the origin of true and absolute Wisdom; the revelation of God, the work of monks, the life of hesychasts, the source of stillness, and expression of the angelic state. Why say more? Prayer is God, who accomplishes everything in everyone (cf 1 Cor. 12:6), for there is a single action of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, activating all things through Christ Jesus. — location: [19876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=19876)

Those who say or do anything without humility are like people who build in winter or without bricks and mortar. Very few acquire humility and know it through experience; and those who try to talk about it are like people measuring a bottomless pit. And I who in my blindness have formed a faint image of this great light am rash enough to say this about it: true humility does not consist in speaking humbly, or in looking humble. The humble person does not have to force himself to think humbly, nor does he keep finding fault with himself. Such conduct may provide us with an occasion for humility or constitute its outward form, but humility itself is a grace and a divine gift. The holy fathers teach that there are two kinds of humility: to regard oneself as lower than everyone else, and to ascribe all one's achievement to God. The first is the beginning, the second the consummation. — location: [19886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=19886)

135. Today's great enemy of truth, drawing men to perdition, is delusion. As a result of this delusion, tenebrous ignorance rules the souls of all those sunk in lethargy and alienates them from God. Such people are as if unaware that there exists a God who gives us rebirth and illumination, or they assume that we can believe in Him and know Him only in a theoretical way and not through our actions, or else they imagine that He has revealed Himself only to the people of former times and not to us also; and they pretend that the scriptural texts about God are applicable only to the original authors, or to others, but not to themselves. Thus they blaspheme the teaching about God, since they repudiate true knowledge inspired by devotion to God, and read the Scriptures only in a literal, not to say Judaic, manner; denying the possibility that man even in this life can be resurrected through the resurrection of his soul, they choose to remain in the grave of ignorance. Delusion consists of three passions: lack of faith, guile and sloth. These generate and support each other: lack of faith sharpens the wits of guile, and guile goes hand in hand with sloth, which expresses itself outwardly in laziness. Or conversely, sloth may beget guile - did not the Lord say, 'You cunning and lazy servant' (Matt. 25:26)? - and guile mothers lack of faith. For if you are full of guile you lack faith, and if you lack faith you stand in no awe of God. From such lack of faith comes sloth, which begets contempt; and when you are full of contempt you scorn all goodness and practice every kind of wickedness. — location: [20107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=20107)

To suffer for Christ's sake is patiently to endure whatever happens to us. For the envy which the innocent provoke is for their benefit, while the Lord's schooling tests us so as to bring about our conversion, since it opens our ears when we are guilty. That is why the Lord has promised an eternal crown to those who endure in this manner (cf. Jas. 1:12). Glory to Thee, our God; glory to Thee, Holy Trinity; glory to Thee for all things. — location: [20134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=20134)

According to Scripture, even that which we possess will be taken away from us at the time of our death or our judgment because of our lack of faith and our despair (cf. Matt. 25:29). — location: [20188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=20188)

For those weak in faith and soul, abstinence from specific types of food is most beneficial; St Paul exhorts them to eat herbs (cf Rom. 14:2), for they do not believe that God will preserve them. — location: [20532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=20532)

And death, properly speaking, is this: for the soul to be unharnessed from divine grace and to be yoked to sin. This death, for those who have their wits, is truly dreadful and something to be avoided. This, for those who think aright, is more terrible than the chastisement of Gehenna. — location: [20784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D587BS2&location=20784)
