They say that the same elder was once sitting in his cell when the devil appeared to him in visible form and said: ‘Get away from here elder, for it is no good for you’. Then the elder said to the demon: ‘To convince me that you want me to go away, make what I am sitting on start walking around’, he was sitting on a wicker-work chair. When the demon heard this, he immediately caused not only the seat, but also the whole cell to move around. When the elder perceived the craftiness of the demon, he said to him: ‘Now, since you are so fierce and terrible, I will most certainly not go away’. He offered a prayer and the hostile demon disappeared.
