Concerning the Emperor Zeno 474-491 one of the fathers told us this: that he wronged a woman by wronging her daughter. She frequented the Church of our all-holy Lady Mary, the Mother of God, beseeching her and saying with tears: ‘Defend my cause against the Emperor Zeno’. When she had continued this for many days, the all-holy Mother of God appeared to her saying: ‘Believe me, woman, I frequently tried to get satisfaction for you, but his right hand prevents me’,—for he was a very good almsgiver.
