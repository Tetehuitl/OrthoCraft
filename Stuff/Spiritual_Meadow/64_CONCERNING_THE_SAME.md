[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Three elders went to visit the same Abba Stephan the priest and whilst they remained there talking about what is beneficial to the soul he remained silent. The elders said to him: ‘You are not answering us father. It was for the benefit of your counsel that we came to you’. Then he said to them: ‘Forgive me, but I did not know what you were talking about until just now. But I can tell you what is matter with me; I can see nothing else, either by night or by day, but our Lord Jesus Christ hanging on the cross’. They went their way greatly edified.
