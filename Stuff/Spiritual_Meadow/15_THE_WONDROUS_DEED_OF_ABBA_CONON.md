They said that Abba Conon, higoumen of the Penthoucla monas- tery, met some Hebrews one day when he was on his way to the holy place of the Bites. They wanted to kill him; they drew their swords and ran towards the elder. But when they reached him and lifted up their hands to strike at him, their hands remained immo- bile in the air. The elder made a prayer on their behalf and they went their way, praising and glorifying God.
