Somebody said that a brother was bitten by a snake and went into the city to receive treatment. He was taken in by a devout woman who feared the Lord and she healed him, When he found some relief from his discomfort, the devil began sowing some libidinous thoughts about the woman in his heart. He began wanting to touch her hand, but she said to him: ‘Not so, father; you have Christ to fear. Think of the sorrow and the remorse in which you shall repent, sitting in your cell. Imagine the sighs you shall utter and the tears you shall shed.’ When he heard this and other similar remarks from her, the war receded from him and he wished to run away in shame—for he could not look her in the face. She, however, in the tender mercy of Christ, said to him: “Do not let shame get the better of you. You are still in need of treatment. Those sinful thoughts did not arise from your pure soul; it was a dart of the envious devil which caused them’, Thus, without offence being cither given or taken, she healed him and sent him on his way, giving him what was needed for the journey.
