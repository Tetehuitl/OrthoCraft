[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
When I and my companion were in Alexandria, one day we went to the Church of Saint Theodosios. A bald man accosted us who was wearing sack-cloth down to his knees. He seemed to be insane. Abba Sophronios said to me: ‘Give me a coin and you shall see the virtue of this man who is approaching us’. I gave him five coppers pholeis which he took and gave to the one who seemed to be insane, who received them without a word. Keeping ourselves out of sight, we followed him. When he had turned the street-corner, he stretched out his right hand (in which he held the coins) towards heaven, held it up high, and then prostrated himself before God— and went his way, leaving the coins on the ground.
