The fathers of the same monastery told us that in former times there was an elder living there named Ianthos, He spent his whole life going off to Coutila. Once while he was in the wilderness some Saracens came into those parts. When they saw the elder, one of them drew his sword and approached him, intending to kill him. When the elder saw the Saracen coming towards him, he raised his eyes to heaven and said: ‘Lord Jesus Christ, thy will be done’. Immediately the earth opened and swallowed up the Saracen. The monk was saved and he went into the monastery, glorifying God.
