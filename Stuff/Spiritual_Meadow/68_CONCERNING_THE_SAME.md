[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
When Abramios, higoumen of the new Church of Saint Mary the Mother of God, learned that Abba Theodosios had no garment to wear in the winter, he bought him a shirt. One night when Theo- dosios sat down to sleep (for he slept on a chair) some thieves  
came, stripped him of his monastic cloak and took it away. When this happened, the elder said nothing about it whatsoever.
