Saint Athanasios, the Pope of Alexandria, was once asked whether a person could be baptised whose beliefs were not in accordance  
 
with the faith and preaching of the Christians, and what would be the fate of—or, how would God receive—somebody who had been baptised under false pretences and had simulated belief. Athansios replied: ‘You have heard from those of old how the blessed martyr, Peter, was faced with a situation in which there was a deadly plague and many were running to be baptised for no other reason than that they feared death. A figure appeared to him which had the appear- ance of an angel and which said to him: “How much longer are you going to send from here those purses which are duly sealed, but are altogether empty and have nothing inside them?” So far as one can tell from the saying of the angel, those who have the sea] of baptism are indeed baptised since they thought they were doing a good work in receiving baptism’,
