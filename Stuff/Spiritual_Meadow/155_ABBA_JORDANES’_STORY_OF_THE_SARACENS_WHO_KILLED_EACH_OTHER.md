Abba Jordanes also told us that Abba Nicholas said to him:  
 
In the reign of the most faithful Emperor Maurice, when the Saracen leader Naaman was making his raids, as I was travelling around Annon and Aidon, I saw three Saracens. They had as their prisoner a very handsome-looking young man, about twenty years old. When he saw me, he began crying to me to take him away from them. So I started begging the Saracens to let him go. One of the Saracens answered me in Greek: ‘We are not Jetting him go’. I said to them: ‘Take me and let him go, for he cannot endure servi- tude’. The same Saracen replied: ‘We are not letting him go’. Then I said to them for the third time: ‘Will you let him go for a ransom? Hand him over to me and I will go seek and bring whatever you demand’. The Saracen replied: ‘We cannot give him to you because we promised our priest that if we took a good-looking prisoner, we would bring him to the priest to be offered as a sacrifice. Now be off with you, or we will cause your head to roll on the ground’. Then I prostrated myself before God and said: ‘O Lord God, our Saviour, save your servant’. The three Saracens immediately became possessed of demons. They drew their swords and cut each other to Pieces. I took the young man to my cave and he no longer wished to leave me. He renounced the world—and after completing seven years in the monastic life, went to his rest. He was from Tyre.
