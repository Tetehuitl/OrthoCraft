At the Lavra of Calamén, near the holy Jordan, Sophronios the Sophist and I met Abba Alexander. There were two monks with him from the Syrians’ monastery at Soubiba. This is what they told us:  
 
Ten days ago, an elder from afar arrived. He came to the monastery of the Besoi at Soubiba and made an offering. He asked the abba of the monastery of his charity to send someone to the neighbouring monastery of the Syrians so that they too could come and receive a donation; and he wanted them to pass on the invitation to the monastery of Chérembé, so that those who lived there would come too. So the abba sent a brother to the higoumen of the:monastery of the Syrians at Soubiba. When the brother arrived, he said to him: ‘Come to the monastery of the Besoi and send a message to the monastery of Chérembé that they should come’. The elder replied: ‘Ihave nobody to send. But do you, of your exceeding great charity, go and tel] them.’ The brother said: ‘I have never been there before and I do not know the way’. Then the elder said to his little dog: ‘Go with the brother to the community of Chérembé so that he can deliver his message’. The dog accompanied the brother until he stood before the gate of the monastery, Those who told us this story showed us the dog, for they had it with them.
