Concerning this Abba Sergios the anchorite, his attendant, Abba Sergios the Armenian, told us that Abba Gregory, higoumen of the Javra at Paran, was very insistent that he should be taken to the elder. ‘So one day’, said the attendant, ‘I took him to the elder who, in those days, was in the region of the Dead Sea. When the  
 
elder saw him, he greeted him with great gladness and, bringing water, washed his feet. All day long he spoke with him about what is beneficial to the soul. The next day he dismissed him. When Abba Gregory had departed, I said to the elder: ‘You know, father, you have rather offended me. Of all the bishops and priests and other people whom I have brought to you, not one of them has ever had his feet washed by you except Abba Gregory and him alone,’ Then the elder said to me: ‘Child, as for Abba Gregory, I do not know who he is. This thing alone I know: that I have received a patriarch in my cave. I saw him wearing the omophorion and carrying the holy gospel’. And that is what came to pass. Six years later God raised up Abba Gregory to the dignity of the patriarchate of Theoupolis =Antioch, as the elder had foreseen.
