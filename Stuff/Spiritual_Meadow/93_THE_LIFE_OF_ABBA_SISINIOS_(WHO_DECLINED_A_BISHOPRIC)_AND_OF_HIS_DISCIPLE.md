This same man, our father Abba George, told us:  
 
One day I went to Abba Sisinios the anchorite. This was an elder who abandoned his own bishopric for the sake of God and had come to lead the life of a solitary near the village called Bethabara, about six miles away from the holy Jordan. When we went to visit him, after much knocking, the door was finally opened to us by his disciple who said to me: ‘Abba, the elder is sick unto death sir, and he has prayed to God not to be taken out of this life until he heard that you had come to this land’,—for I had been in Constantinople on monastic business, at the court of the most pious Emperor Tiberius. The disciple went up to the elder and told him about me. When he came back down some considerable time later, he said to us: ‘He is at your service’. We went up and found the elder already dead. So I realised that when he heard that it was I who was knocking, it was then that he went to the Lord. As I embraced him, the dead man meekly said to me: ‘My abba is welcome!’—and he fell asleep again. Then I let it be known to the household that they could come and bury the elder. They came and, as they were digging the grave, the disciple of the elder said to the grave-diggers: “Of your charity dig it a little wider so that it can accommodate both of us’, and whilst they were still digging, he lay down on a mat of reeds and died. They buried the two of them together, the elder and the disciple.
