[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Abba Irenaeus told us that there was an elder living at Scété who saw the devil at night offering gardening implements ? to the brethren. The elder said to the devil: ‘What are these”? The devil  
 
replied: ‘I am presenting the brothers with a distraction to make them less assiduous in glorifying God’. The same Abba Irenaeus spoke to us again saying: When barbarians came to Scété, I withdrew and came into the district of Gaza, where I accepted a cell for myself at the Lavra. From the abba of the Lavra I received a book of sayings of the elders. The same day I set myself to read it and, as soon as I unrolled the book, I found a passage in which a brother visited and elder and said to him: ‘Pray for me father’. The elder said: ‘When you were with us I used to pray for you. Now you have gone away to your own homeland I pray for you no longer’. When I read this, I rewound the book and said to myself: ‘Oh wretched Irenaeus, to have fled to your own homeland—and the fathers no longer pray for you!’ I immediately gave the book back to the abba, left that place and came to The Cellls. And that, children, is why I am here.
