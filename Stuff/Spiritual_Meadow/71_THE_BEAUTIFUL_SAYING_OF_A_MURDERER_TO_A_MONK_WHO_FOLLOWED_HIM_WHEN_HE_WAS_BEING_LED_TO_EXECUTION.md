The same Abba, Palladios, told us of something that happened at Arsinoé, a city of the Thebaid. A man was arrested there for murder. After suffering many tortures, he was finally condemned to be beheaded. As he was being taken to where he had committed the murder (a point about six miles outside the city), there was a monk following behind, apparently with the intention of seeing how he would be decapitated. As he passed along the way to his execution, the condemned man saw the monk who was following and said to him: ‘Well now, abba, have you no cell, sir, nor any work to occupy your hands?’ The monk answered: ‘Of course I have a cell, brother, and also something to occupy my hands’. The man rejoined: ‘Then why do you not stay in your cell and weep for your sins?’ The monk replied: ‘Ah, brother, I am very negligent of my soul’s health—and that is precisely why I am coming to see how you die, that by this means I might come to have some compunction’. The condemned man said to him: ‘Go your way, abba; remain in your cell, sir, and give thanks to God who saved us. It was because he was made man and died for us that man dies no more the eternal death.’
