Abba John the Cilician told us that while they were staying at the ninth mile-post from Alexandria, an Egyptian monk visited us and said: ‘A brother from foreign parts came to the Lavra of The Cells and wanted to stay there. He prostrated himself before the priest presbyteros and requested that he might stay the night at the cell of Evagrios. The priest told him that he could not stay there. The  
 
brother said: ‘If I may not stay there, I will go away’. The priest said to him: ‘My child, the fact of the matter is that a cruel demon inhabits that place. It led Evagrios astray, alienating him from the true faith, and it filled his mind with abominable teachings’. The brother persisted, saying: ‘If 1 am to remain here, that is where lam going to stay’. Then the priest said: ‘On your own head be it: go and stay there’. The brother went and stayed there for a week and, when the holy day of the Lord came round, he came to the church. The priest was relieved to sce him. The following Sunday he did not come to the church, so the priest summoned two brothers to go and find out why he was not present in church. They went to the cell and found that the brother had put a rope around his neck and strangled himself.
