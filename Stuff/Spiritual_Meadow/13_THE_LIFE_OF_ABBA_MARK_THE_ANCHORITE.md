They said that Abba Mark the anchorite who lived near the Penthoucla monastery practised the austerity of fasting all week long for sixty-nine years, with the result that some people thought he was  
 
incorporeal. He also laboured night and day in accordance with Christ’s commandments. What he gained he gave to the poor and he never accepted anything from anybody. There were some people, friends of Christ, who heard of him and came, intending to give him some charitable donation. But he said to them: ‘I do not accept alms. The labour of my hands is sufficient both for me and for those who come to me by the grace of God’.
