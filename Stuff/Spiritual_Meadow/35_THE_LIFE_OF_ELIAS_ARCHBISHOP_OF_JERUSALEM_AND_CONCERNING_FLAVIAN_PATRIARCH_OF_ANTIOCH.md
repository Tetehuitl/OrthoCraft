Abba Polychronios said of Abba Elias, Archbishop of Jerusalem, that when he was a monk he never drank wine and after he became patriarch he continued to observe the same rule. They said of Archbishop Elias of Jerusalem and of Flavian the Archbishop of Antioch that the Emperor Anastasios exiled them both on account of the holy synod of the fathers at Chalcedon: Eilias to Eilat, Flavian to Petra, One day the two patriarchs revealed to each other that Anastasios had died that very day. ‘Let us go, too, to be judged with him’, they said, and two days later they went to the Lord.
