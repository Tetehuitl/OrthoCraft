Abba Menas, higoumen of the monastery of Abba Severian, said this about Abba Sophronios the grazer: ‘He grazed around the Dead Sea. For seventy years he went naked, eating wild plants and nothing οἶδε whatsoever.’ Abba Menas also said he had heard Abba Sophronios say: ‘I prayed to the Lord that the demons would not come near my cave. I saw them coming to within three stades of the cave, but they were unable to come any nearer.’ Abba Menas said to the brothers who were in the community: ‘My little children, let us avoid communications with those of the world for these can be hurtful, especially to younger monks’. He also said: ‘Persons of every age, both young and old, need to repent in order to enjoy eternal life in the future with praise and great glory. Young men need to repent because in the full flood of carnal desire they have bent their necks beneath the yoke; old men, that they might change their propensity for evil which has been reinforced by long habitude.”
