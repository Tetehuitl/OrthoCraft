*The fortieth day after His birth, the All-holy Virgin brought her divine Son into the Temple of Jerusalem, in accordance with the Law, to dedicate Him to God and to purify herself [[Leviticus 12]]:2-7; [[Exodus 12#^2|Exodus 12:2]].*
    
### Gospel
22.  And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
2.  (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
3.  And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
4.  And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
5.  And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
6.  And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
7.  Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
8.  Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
9.  For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
10.  Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
11.  A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
12.  And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
13.  And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
14.  (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
15.  And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
16.  And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
17.  And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
18.  And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
19.  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
[[Luke 2#^22|Luke 2:22-40]]

### The Righteous Simeon
The righteous Simeon is said to have lived hundreds of years before his meeting with our Lord Jesus Christ in the temple. He was one of the translators of the Septuagint. When he translated *"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."* [[Isaiah 7#^14|Isaiah 7:14]] he couldn't conceive in himself the possibility that a virgin could do such a thing. So, he prayed God would let him live long enough to see such a miracle, and God granted it to him.

In the [[033-february-2|Prologue]] we read that after the pronouncements of the Righteous Simeon and the Prophetess Anna was heard by the Pharisees St. Joseph and the Holy Virgin fled to Egypt with the Christ Child.

### Purification
Every Jewish women who conceived a son was considered unclean because of the blood spilled and was to keep herself and the child from the temple or anything sanctified to God for 7 days. On the 8th day she was to bring the son to be circumcised by the priests. After the eighth day she was to continue her purification for 33 days. After this time of purification the mother was to bring a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a turtledove for a sin offering. [[Leviticus 12]]

The custom is still kept in the Church. On the eighth day the mother and the child are brought into the church and the child is presented to God in the altar if he is a male but brought only before the royal doors if she is female. The mother and child is then to not return to the Church until the 40th day for the child to be baptized.
