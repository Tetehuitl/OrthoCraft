All the bows are from the waist. During the [[Great Lent]] 17 bows to the ground are added for each [[Lestovka]].

During the [[Great Lent]], after kathisma there are special troparion, prayers and bows as ordered by the [[Psalter]].

The [[Services]] listed here should each begin and end with the customary [[Introductory and Departure Bows]].
