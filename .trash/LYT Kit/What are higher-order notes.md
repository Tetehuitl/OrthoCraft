# What are higher-order notes?
First let's zoom out. Every note in a note library is a note. They come in two basic varieties: 

1. [[What is a note|Note]]
2. Note with mostly links to other notes

Let's agree for the moment that a note with mostly words is less complex than a note with mostly links. 

A note with mostly links can therefore be considered a *higher-order note*. It is still a note, but all those links help to provide some sort of structure that adds complexity to the note itself. 

Let's explore the wonderful world of higher-order notes.

### What can we call higher-order notes?
- Link Note - A term that describes what is contains: links
- Structure Note - A term that describes what it does: structures stuff
- Hub Note - A Luhmann term, same idea
- Structure Zettel - A term from zettelkasten.de - Specifically used as a linear Table of Contents, sometimes with annotations.
- Outline Note - Another table of contents note
- MOC (Map of Content) - A diverse and flexible higher-order note that serves multiple purposes.

### What makes an MOC so special?
Here's what else an MOC can do in additional to being used as a basic  navigational tool:
	- [[MOCs concentrate idea interaction]]
	- [[MOCs accelerate ideation]]
	- MOCs can be a combo of links and tags
	- MOCs can be non-linear structured links by any category one might want to use
	- MOCs can be links to other MOCs, which eventually link to an Index note

Now let's answer the question: [[Why call higher-order notes MOCs]]?

---
#### MOCs can be called other things of course. 
Consider the term "Salons" as described by Bob Bain and @mediapathic.

> A "gathering of ideas" and a "space to allow ideas to interact and"support" or "extend" or "challenge" other ideas" (from @bbain 's work)

> A "sort of emergent democratic process" (from @mediapathic 's work)

You can test any concept or metaphor against the thresholds listed above. Your mileage may vary. 

The point here is that you can call a higher-order note whatever you want, in the end, it's just a bunch of links in a note. What you *do* with those links makes all the difference.
