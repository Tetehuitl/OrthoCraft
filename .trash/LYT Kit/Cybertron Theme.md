# Cyberron
This is my true love (formerly known as CyberDynalSynth), which has been rebooted as “Cybertron”. You will either love this theme, or avoid it at all costs.

Although it’s inspired to be retro, it’s crazy how useful I find it. I get an incredible amount of work accomplished in it. I do my creative work in Cybertron.

1. **Dynalist**
2. **Cyberpunk 2077**
3. **Synthwave**
4. **Keanu Reeves**
5. **The Terminator**

## Cool Aspects
While stylized, I actually find CyberTron to be extremely practical. It seems to encourage creativity.

**Bold**

Notables:

- Dark mode only
- Bold has its own color
- Italics has its own color
- Andy Mode v2 (thanks @death.au)
- cool checkboxes (thanks @death.au)

#### Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. [[Richard McClintock]], a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
