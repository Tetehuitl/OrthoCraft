# Levels of Magnification
*Analyzing a Problem Through Three Different Levels of Magnification*
I have found it useful to use three different levels of magnification when looking at some Thing and asking the question: 

*"What's the Problem?"*

- **Conceptual** — This is the high-level perspective, philosophical, theoretical, existential
- **Practical** — No fancy language, just the actual how-to of something
- **Technical** — The nuts and bolts, diving deep into the specifics of a thing
