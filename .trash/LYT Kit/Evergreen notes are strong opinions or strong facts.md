## Evergreen notes are strong opinions or strong facts
Most evergreen notes should be statements with a strong opinions. That's because it forces you to really think about what you're trying to say.

Exceptions to this principle are Fact-based things like:
- Concepts: which can and should stand on their own
- Known Things: "The magna carta was signed in 1215"
- Standards: Things with a pre-set language (whether that's programming, Things that follow a process, manuals, etc
	- examples include anything from mathematical formulas, to the basics of language, to the process of putting a bike together

That said, those Fact-based evergreen notes should then spawn ideas of your own that have strong opinions. For example:
- The note on the `[[Magna Carta]]` (Strong Fact) can then link to a personalized note titled `[[No one is above the law]]` (Strong Opinion), which could link to another note titled `[[Protests can invoke radical change]]` (Strong Opinion).
- A note on `[[Defining a variable]]` (Strong Fact) can link to a personalized note on `[[Understanding variables leads to higher level thinking]]` (Strong Opinion).
- A note on the concept `[[Like begets like]]` (kinda both Strong Opinion and Fact) can link to the opinion `[[The neural formation of habits are additive]]` and a bunch of other notes. See this example below:

In this way, Fact-based Evergreen Notes are sturdy dots that we can then connect to other Opinion-based Evergreen Notes through a lovely process called thinking.

This is my [[Strong opinions, weakly held]].
