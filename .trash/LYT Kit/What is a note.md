# What is a note?
A note is any container of thought. 

Pretty broad, huh? A note could be a single idea, or any entire library of thoughts. It can hold data about a person, or log the current phase of the moon. The contents of a note are limited only by our imaginations. 

This infinitely broad definition means that it can be useful to define the type of note. This can be done in discussion, i.e., "I'm working on a source note," or it can be done in other ways, like using tags or MOC notes. See [In what ways can we form useful relationships between notes?](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6?source=friends_link&sk=2d046d81486ed09694d1f5e36e52ff00).
