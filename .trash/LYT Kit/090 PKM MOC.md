### Main Folders
- **Resources**: Great for private notes, images, templates, and archives. Additionally, you might consider having folders for any of the following: people, recipes, quotes
- **Sources**: Put outside, source content here. Remember, you should filter what enters this folder in the first place. 
- **Timestamps**: Think about what notes you might want to sort by date. Good examples of note types are:
	- Daily Notes | Journals | Meetings | Workouts | Logs | Tracking Notes
	- Outputted Materials: Articles, Speeches, etc
		- Personally, I prefer to keep these in the main space. As a rule of thumb, whenever you can get rid navigating folders, you probably should.
- **Workspaces**: This is where you can keep business and/or big project-specific folders.

### Note Best Practices
**New, But Blank, Notes**
- I prefer "post-pending" `TK` if the note is just a filename placeholder.  Like: `[[Filename placeholder TK]]`. Then you can just search for "TK".

**Source Notes**
- Always tag: #source  |  Then add description/topic tags
- If you've added commentary, add: #commentary
