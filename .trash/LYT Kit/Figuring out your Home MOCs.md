# Figuring out your Home MOCs
Your Home MOCs are just your main categories of personal knowledge. They should be broad. At first, you'll probably only need 2-3. Try to stay below 10 or so. These are my main categories of personal knowledge. They are easy to change and rename to your heart's content. All the prep work is done for you. 

```
- 010 - [[010 Mindsets MOC|Mindsets]]
- 020 - [[020 Concepts MOC|Concepts]] — #concept | #develop
- 030 - [[030 Interests MOC|Interests]] — #MOC
- 040 - [[040 Writings MOC|Writings]] — #journal | #writings | #output
- 050 - [[050 Sources MOC|Sources]] — #source | #commentary
- 060 - [[060 People MOC|People]] — #people | #waiting | #meeting
- 070 - [[070 Health MOC|Health]] — #health | #workout 
- 080 - [[080 Goals MOC|Goals]] — #goals | #gameplan | #wins
- 085 - [[085 Compass MOC|Compass]]
- 090 - [[090 PKM MOC|PKM]] — [[Template for Files]] #template | #reference
- 095 - [[095 Lists MOC|Lists]] — #faves
- 100 - [[100 Projects MOC|Projects]] — #project 
```

### How to Customize your Home MOCs
It's easy, if you want to change 050 from Sources to Habits it would go from this:

`[[050 Sources MOC|Sources]]`

to this:

`[[050 Habits MOC|Habits]]`, which looks like [[050 Habits MOC|Habits]].

Boom.

Then go to  [[050 Habits MOC|Habits]] and start working!
