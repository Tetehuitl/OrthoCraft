# Spatial Context
The ancients had to rely on their memories to hold onto information. They developed mind palaces and other mneumonic devices. Central to their efforts of recalling information was placing their atoms of information into a Spatial Context. It turns out our spatial context is an extremely strong form of memory. A term for using a spatial context for memory is called the [[Method of Loci]].
