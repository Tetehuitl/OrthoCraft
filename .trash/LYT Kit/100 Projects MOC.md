# Projects MOC
There are excellent ways to manage projects and tasks with linked frameworks. However, the LYT opinion is to that most projects need *less* maintenance work, not more. Don't micro-manage yourself. Keep it spartan. Give yourself a broad direction and let your own ingenuity surprise you. That's why the following are deliberately minimal project "cover pages".

*Template*
- [[P- ProjectOKR]]

*Active* — #activeProject
- [[P- LYT Kit v4]]

*Past* — #pastProject
- [[P- LYT Course v1]]
- [[P- IMF Kit v3]]
