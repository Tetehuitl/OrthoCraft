# Gall's Law
The only structure that can work over time, is the structure that slowly emerges over time—validating its own existence through its successful use. 

Practically speaking, DO NOT start structuring your "ultimate" system in one fell swoop. It will fail you, because it will be fragile, because it wasn't forged in the fire of practical usage. You will waste time and enthusiasm—and could possibly burn out. 

### Wiki
Gall's Law is a rule of thumb for systems design: 

- *A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works* and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

This law...can be used to explain the success of systems like the World Wide Web and Blogosphere, which grew from simple to complex systems incrementally, and the failure of systems like CORBA, which began with complex specifications.
