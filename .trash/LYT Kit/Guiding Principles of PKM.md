# Guiding Principles of PKM
When it comes to managing your digital knowledge, the following are some guiding values and principles to consider.

### Guiding Values
*A digital library should:*
1. Possess Excellent Note Retrieval (both today and in 10 years)
2. Be Future-Proofed (ensure notes are not fragile but robust [^1])
3. Be a Joy to Use
5. Encourage Deep, Engaged Contextual Thinking
6. Allow for the Spontaneous Cross-Pollination of Ideas
7. Produce Finished Products (when desired)
8. Accumulate in Knowledge over Time
9. Compound in Value over Time
10. Encourage Repetition (repetitions strengthen memory)

These values are cultivated in the [[LYT System]]. Go there after reading the rest here.

### Guiding Principles
1. The more ways you can access a note, the better chance you have of retrieving it. (Accessibility) (Can I find it when I want it?)
2. The more contexts a note has, the better the chance you have of discovering it. (Contextual Breadcrumbs) (Can I stumble upon it?)
3. Most notes should try to not go longer than a page - if they do, consider splitting them. (Atomic Notes) [^2] (Is it a solid idea I can add to over time?)
4. Making connections between notes fosters new insights. It enhances note retrieval and memory. (Connections) (What does this relate to?)
5. Getting repetitions in our library improves our memory. (Repetitions) (Reps, Reps, Reps.)
6. A digital library should make sense and be useable to someone else (assuming they are familar with zettelkasten)â€”including your Future Self. (Readability) (Does this make sense?)

### Guiding Questions
1. Can I find what I'm looking for? Quickly? Easily?
2. Am I able to think fast? Am I able to think deeply?
3. Can I be surprised by serendipitous connections?

[^1]: Much can be said about future-proofing your notes. In short: be aware of how software is locking you in. And don't trust exporters, there is little incentive for the companies to allow you to export perfectly out of their software (ie Evernote), although customers are demanding that now and there are many good players like Bear and Obsidian.
[^2]: Note Atomicity is a term coined over at the excellent site zettelkasten.de. It's basically: one idea should equal one note. I'm relaxed in this, so I guess I practice a looser, Laissez Faire note atomicity.
