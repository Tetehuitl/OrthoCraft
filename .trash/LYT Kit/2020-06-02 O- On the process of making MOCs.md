### On the process of making MOCs
It's no secret that some people (okay, mostly me) believe MOCs (Maps of Content) to be one of the ultimate thinking tools. 

This quick kit is to get you immediately hands-on with a practical example of utilizing an MOC to think and create. It goes through a 3-stage lifecycle. 

As always, experiment, learn by doing, and see how these methods might work for you! Included:

- 32 Notes
- A practical 3-stage example of utilizing an MOC

MOCs help us get us Mental Squeeze Points, encourage awesome thinking, create favorable conditions for flow, allow us to create meaningful spatial constellations of thought, have limitless interpretations, and are non-destructive, non-limiting because they act as fluid, augmented layers.

Enjoy!
