# MOCs are Dialectics
Ideas are often forged in argument where opposing propositions are set against each other.

This is what happens when notes are placed in a room together and forced to figure things out. 

Ideas bump and jostle. Some combine into something greater. Some split apart and stand on their own. Some are challenged and grow stronger, others are challenged and go away. Some are born into creation out of necessity. 

MOCs create the conditions of a Hegelian dialectic, with you acting as arbiter. Notes enter with some sort of unique idea (Thesis). They encounter conflicts with each other (Antithesis). After many arguments, a general spatial arrangement is reached (Synthesis).

This is super powerful.
