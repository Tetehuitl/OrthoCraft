# Set Up Your Home Note
1. Go to the home note. Check it out. 
	- Review the Home MOCs.
      - Do you see categories that relate to you?
    - Review the keywords below
2. Now starting clicking all the links. Get familiar with the pages. 
	- Do you notice how you can always quickly click back to the Home note (or at least to an MOC, and then back to the Home note)? That's powerful.
	- Do you see any patterns with how some of the Home MOCs are structured? Any you could imagine using?
4. What MOC is a subject you already have notes on? 
	- Start linking your own notes to that existing MOC. 
5. Customize that MOC to your heart's content.

That's the basic process.

Remember, the structure works for YOU, not the other way around (See [[Is LYT For Me]]). You can always just create thousands of notes without looking at the home note once.

### Advanced steps
1. In the [[000 Home|Home]] note, start customizing the Home MOCs to suit your personal needs. Less is more at the start of your journey.
2. Play around, break things. Some categories you thought would work won't. That's fine, just rejigger things until they work better for you.
