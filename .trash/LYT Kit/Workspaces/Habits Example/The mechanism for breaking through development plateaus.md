### The mechanism for breaking through development plateaus
- [ ] Needs more clarification on "gaming" the curve

To break through the a-curve plateau, we must get out of our newly established "automatic mindset", and return to a beginner's "cognitive mindset". 

Physical development by strength training is the clearest example. 
Russian Conjugate Periodization [^1]—used for the physical development of Olympic athletes—shows how to "game" the curve by evolving the routine around every 4-5 weeks, which forces the muscles into their own form of "cognitive thinking."

A key term here is "adaption." (explore Tom Mysklinski's article to put it into context)

Perhaps continual improvement through this lens can be summed up with a phrase used by the US Marine Corps, Viggo Mortensen, and Clint Eastwood: 

> “Adapt and Overcome."

It’s just about knowing what to overcome…and with skill development, that's called [[Deliberate Practice TK]].
