# Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia
While some [[Positive Feedback Loop]]s show immediate results, many times progress is hidden until much further along in time. This type of progress, where it's not obvious and visible is basically "hidden inertia". 

Whatever is happening above ground, below ground it's like trying to push a railroad car; nothing seems to happen for the longest time, but eventually the momentum build and takes on a life of its own, just like Jim Collins [[Flywheel Effect]] or Shelley's [[Frankenstein Monster]].

This relates to one of my all-time favorite truisms: [[Like begets like]].

And here are a couple other riffs on that: 

> A rolling snowball gathers more snow. 
> Change your mind to change your brain, to eventually—after building up tons of inertia—change your mind.
