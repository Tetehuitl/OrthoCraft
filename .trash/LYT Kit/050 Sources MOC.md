# Sources MOC
Use tags instead of MOCs, unless you have a specific reason to create a new MOC.

Two simple levels of processing.
««— | #source | #commentary | —»»

Special sources
| #book | #researchPaper (RP) |

Descriptor Book Tags: Choose one per book
| #dontRead | #toRead | #reading | #finished | #toProcess |

| [[Books I've Read MOC]] | [[Books Purgatory List]] | #book100 |

### Commentary
Other Sources? I recommend just tagging with: #source. But if you want, you could add more granular descriptors like: “tweets, texts, articles”.

In between tagging source and commentary, you could add an extra step called “highlights”, but that’s usually redundant. Every source you add should have a few highlights, or else you’re just collecting.
