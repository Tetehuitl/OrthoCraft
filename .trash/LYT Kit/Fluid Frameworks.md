# Fluid Frameworks
Fluid frameworks are non-rigid, highly-flexible organizing structures that you can use as needed. When we talk about fluid frameworks in the LYT Kit, we're mainly referring to MOCs and the home note.

Folders are a rigid framework because they impose rigidity and reduce the number of access points you have to access information. 

*Fluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive.* If set up correctly, you can use several frameworks in tandem in complete harmony.

- A framework is an essential supporting structure. 
- A fluid framework is a non-essential supporting structure. 

This is a deep rabbit hole, so for now, go to: [[Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea]]

See the inspiration for using the term "fluid" at [[Fluid Taxonomies]].
