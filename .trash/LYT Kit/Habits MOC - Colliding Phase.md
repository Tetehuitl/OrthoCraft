# Habits MOC - Colliding Phase
## Day 1
*Battle, Collide, Dismember, Combine, Craft, Discover* - Have your ideas battle for relational positioning. This is the most joyous and valuable stage.

Naturally, excitedly, organically—without a task manager telling me what to do—I open up the first note (which was [[201303102051 Habit Planning]]) and I craft it into an Evergreen Note. But I when I try to name it, I realize it's too big, so I split it up into two evergreen notes:

[[The neural formation of habits is additive - v1]][^1]
[[The truest habit metaphors are additive - v1]]

And I leave the others alone for now. 

[[201502201031 Habit Formation Research Article]]
[[201502201713 Habit Concepts and Theory]]
[[201910011142 Atomic Habits]]
[[201901250999 Resiliency Routines]]

I'm done for the night. I'm comforted by this MOC; my notes have a digital workbench to rest upon. I'm satisfied with creating two evergreen notes. They have value to me. I go to sleep smiling.

## Day 2
I continued where I left off. This was the big session where the magic happened.

Now look at your collected notes and the questions will just arrive, unforced: What are they trying to say? What is redundant? What note needs to be split into two? What outside concepts relate to this? You naturally work yourself into a state of Flow and time becomes timeless; effort effortless.

- [[The neural formation of habits is additive]] - This note shrank. It went into other notes, most notably a new evergreen note on the evolutionary function of habits.
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]] - I already had this note
- [[An asymptotic curve models the development of skills, strength, habits, and more]] - I wanted to single out the importance of a graph curve in describing habits and a bunch of other stuff
	- [[The mechanism for breaking through development plateaus]] - The other half of the coin is figuring out how to "game" this curve to avoid plateaus to our developments

--- 
- [[Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues]] - this started as notes from The Power of Habit, but I reduced its scope when I gave it a clear title.
	- [[Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013]] - here's a practical way to chart out habits
	- [[How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits]] - I had notes from a book on habits, but tried to re-fashion it more tightly into the rest of this corpus on habits
	- [[Resiliency Routines help regain a sense of control]] - this is partially a journal but it's valuable to the conversation on habits
	- [[Words I've used to describe important habits]] - this is more like a journal; it's of limited value to others

- [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]] - This was talked about in several notes, but it needed to be a foundational point.
- [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]] - While writing about how neural formations strengthen, I tried to figure out how to best express the hidden momentum of habits. It needed its own note.

- [[Defining a habit]] - I realized I needed a note define the actual thing I've been talking about

I also try to keep track of the standalone concepts I've roped in here:
[[Positive Feedback Loop]]
[[Cobwebs into Cables]]
[[Natural Selection]]
[[Survival of the Fittest TK]]
[[Selfish Gene TK]]
