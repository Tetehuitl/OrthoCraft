One of the elders told us that once, when Abba Stephan, priest of the Lavra of the Aliotes, was sitting in his cell, the devil put evil thoughts into his mind, saying: ‘Go somewhere else, for it is not good staying here’. The elder said to the devil: ‘I do not accept what you say; I know who you are. You do not want to see anybody saved, but Christ, the Son of the living God, he will overthrow you!”
