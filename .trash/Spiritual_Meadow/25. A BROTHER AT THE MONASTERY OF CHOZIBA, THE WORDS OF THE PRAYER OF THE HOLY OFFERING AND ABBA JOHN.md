[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Abba Gregory, a former member of the Imperial Guard, told us of a brother at the Community of Choziba who had learned by heart the words used at the offering of the holy gifts. One day he was sent to fetch the eucharistic oblations and, as he returned to the monastery, he said the offering prayer—as though he were reciting verses. The deacons placed the same oblations on the paten in the holy sanctuary. The priest at that time was Abba John the Chozi- bite who later became Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine. When he offered the gifts, he did not perceive the coming of the Holy Spirit in the accustomed manner. He was distressed, thinking that it might be on account of some sin on his part that the Holy Spirit was absent. He withdrew into the sacristy in tears and flung himself face- down. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: ‘Because the brother who was bringing the oblations here recited the holy prayer of offering on the way, they are already consecrated and made perfect’. The elder laid down a rule that from henceforth nobody was to learn the holy prayer of offering unless he had been ordained; nor was it ever to be recited at any time other than in a consecrated place.
