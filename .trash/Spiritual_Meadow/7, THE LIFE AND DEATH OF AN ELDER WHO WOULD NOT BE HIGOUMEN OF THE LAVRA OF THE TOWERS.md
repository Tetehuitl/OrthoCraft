[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
There was an elder dwelling at the Lavra of the Towers and when the higoumen died, the priests and other brethren at the lavra wanted to make him higoumen because of his great virtue. The elder begged them not to, saying: ‘Let me rather go and weep for my sins, fathers, for I am no fit man to undertake the care of souls. This is a task for great fathers such as those who were with Abba Anthony and the others’. The brethren, however, would not permit this, Each day they came begging him to accept, but he would not. When he saw that they were determined to make him change his mind, he said to them all; ‘Give me three days for prayer and I shall do whatever God requires of me’, This was on a Friday: He died on the Sunday morning.
