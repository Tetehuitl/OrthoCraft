This story was told to us concerning Abba George, higoumen of the monastery of Abba Theodosios, by his disciple—that good, gentle and humble Abba Theodosios who became Bishop of Capitolias. He spent twelve years watching the elder to see if he was ever even once upset and he zever saw him upset; and that was in these present times when there is so much negligence and insubordination in vogue. ‘Who ever kept his cyes so firmly riveted to the ground as our saintly father George?’ said his disciple. ‘Who ever so shut the doors of his ears as this blessed one? Who was there who kept his tongue a prisoner as did our father? What ray of the sun ever shone on the earth so brightly as this, our father, illuminated the hearts of us all?’
