One of the fathers told us that there was formerly an archbishop of Theoupolis =Antioch whose goodness was such that once when there was a feast-day he invited several of the clergy who had celebrated the feast with him to dinner. There was one of them who refused the invitation. The patriarch made no comment but on another occasion he went personally to find the cleric and invited him to share his table. They also told this story about the same Archbishop Theodotos: such were his humility and lowliness that ‘once he was travelling with one of his clergy, the bishop reclining in a litter whilst the cleric rode a horse. The patriarch said to him: ‘Let us defray the tedium of the journey by exchanging our modes of travel’, ‘It would disgrace the patriarch’ said the cleric, ‘if I were to get into the litter and he to mount the horse’. The godly Theodotos would have nothing of that. He persuaded his attendant cleric that it would be no disgrace and so prevailed upon him to make the exchange.
