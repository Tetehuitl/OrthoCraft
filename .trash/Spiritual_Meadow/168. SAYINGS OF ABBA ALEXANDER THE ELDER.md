Abba Alexander, the elder of Abba Vincent, said to the brethren: ‘Our fathers sought out the wildemess and affliction; we seek for cities and comfort’.  
 
Again: ‘In the days of our fathers, the virtues of poverty and humility flourished; these days, avarice and pride are in fashion’.  
 
Again: ‘Our fathers never used to wash their faces; but we indulge ourselves at the public baths’.  
 
Again: ‘Alas, children, we have eliminated the angelic way of life’.  
 
Abba Vincent, his disciple, said to him: ‘We are indeed sickly, father’. The elder rejoined: ‘What do you mean, Vincent, by “We are sickly?” Believe me child: we are fit in body as Olympic athletes, but we are sick indeed in the soul.’  
 
Again: ‘We are able to eat and drink a great deal and to wear fine clothing; but we are incapable of mastering our passions or our pride.”  
 
Again the elder said: ‘Oh. Alexander, Alexander! How you are going to be put to shame when others receive the crown!’
