Abba Cyril, the disciple of the aforementioned Abba Julian the Stylite, told this story:  
 
I and my father and brother, hearing what was said about Abba Julian, came to him from our own country. I had an incurable disease which no doctor was able to heal. The elder healed me with prayer as soon as I arrived. So the three of us stayed with him and Tenounced the world. The elder appointed my father to be in charge of the grain. One day my father came to Abba Julian and said: ‘We have no grain’. The elder replied: ‘Go, gather together whatever you can find and grind it up. God will take care of tomorrow for us’. My father was troubled by this command for he knew there was nothing left in the granary; he withdrew to his cell. When need became very pressing, the elder indicated that he was to come to him and as soon as he entered, he said to him: ‘Brother Conon, go and prepare whatever you find for the brethren’, Almost in anger he took the keys of the granary and went off, intending to bring back some earth. Having released the lock he wanted to open the doors, but he could not do so because the granary was com- pletely filled with grain. When he saw this he humbly prostrated himself before the elder, glorifying God.
