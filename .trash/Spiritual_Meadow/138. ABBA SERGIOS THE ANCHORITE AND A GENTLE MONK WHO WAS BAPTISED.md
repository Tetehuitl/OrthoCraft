The elder told us this too:  
 
When Abba Sergios was an anchorite at Rouba, after he had withdrawn from Sinai, he-sent a young monk from there to the monastery to be baptised. When we asked why he had not been baptised, the attendant of Abba Sergios (also named Abba Sergios) said: When this man came wanting to stay with us in the wilderness, I, as attendant, received him and greatly exhorted him not to commit himself to this way of life without a period of probation. Having perceived his determination, the next day I took him to the elder. As soon as the elder saw him, before I had said a word, he said to me privately; “What does the brother want?” I said: “He is asking to become one of us”. Then the elder said to me: “Believe me, brother, he has not been baptised. But take him to the Monastery of the Eunuchs and they will have him baptised in the holy Jordan.”’ In my amazement at what_was said, I asked the brother who he was and where he was from. He said he was from the west and that his parents were pagans. He did not know whether he was baptised or not. We therefore catechised him and had him baptised in the holy Jordan, He stayed in the monastery, giving thanks to God.
