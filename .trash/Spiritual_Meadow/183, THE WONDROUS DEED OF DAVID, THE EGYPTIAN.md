Abba Theodore the Cilician said:  
 
When I was staying at Scété, there was an elder there called David. One day he went out with some other monks to reap. The Scetiotes have this custom, that they go out to the estates and reap. The elder went to an estate and offered himself for hire an a day-to-day basis. A farmer hired him and as the elder was reaping .. about the sixth hour it was very hot, so the elder entered a shack and sat down, When the farmer came and saw him sitting there, he said to him angrily: ‘Elder, why are you not reaping? Do you not realise that I am paying you?’ He said: ‘Yes, but the heat is so intense that the grains of wheat are falling out of the husks. I am waiting a lite for the heat to abate so that you suffer no loss.’ The farmer said to him: ‘Get up and work, even if everything bursts into flames’. The elder said to him: ‘Do you want it all to burn?’ The farmer angrily rejoined: ‘Isn’t that what I said?’ The elder stood up, and suddenly  
 
the field began to burn. Then, in fear, the farmer came to the other  
 
part of the field where the other elders were reaping. He begged them to come and intercede with the elder for him, to pray that the fire might cease. They came and made an act of obeisance to the elder, who said: ‘But he himself said that it should burn’. Yet they were able to convince him, He went and stood between that part of the field which was burning and that which remained unscathed. He offered a prayer and immediately the fire in the field was extin- guished. The rest of the crop was saved. Everybody was amazed and glorified God.
