At the Lavra of the Towers there was an elder named Myrogenes who had been so harsh in his treatment of himself that he developed dropsy. He would often say to the elders who came by to take care of him: ‘Pray for me, fathers, so that I do not develop dropsy in my inner man. I pray to God that I may endure this sickness for a long time’. When Eutychios, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, heard about this, he wanted to send Abba Myrogenes al] that he needed; but he never got anything back in reply to his offer other than: ‘Pray for me father, that I might be delivered from eternal torment’.
