[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Sorouda is a village in the vicinity of the city of Coeana. There is a font there which exudes liquid on the feast of the Epiphany. It fills itself up in this way over a period of three hours and, after the baptism, it slowly empties itself again, taking three hours to do so.
