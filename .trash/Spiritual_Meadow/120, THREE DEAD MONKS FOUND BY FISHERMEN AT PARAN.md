[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Some fishermen of Paran told us this:  
 
Once we went to Bouchti, at the other side of the Red Sea. We took a good catch and made our way back. We anchored off Pteleos, wanting to sail on to Raithou, but we were detained by contrary winds. A heavy sea held us up for ninety days. Venturing into that great wilderness, we found three anchorites dead under one stone.  
 
(They wore habits of palm-fibre and their cloaks were lying beside them. We brought the three corpses to the ship and at once the stormy sea subsided, The winds shifted into a favourable direction. We sailed with a following wind and came to Raithou, The fathers buried them, together with the elders of former times.)
