[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
There was an elder living in the monastery of our holy father, Theodosios, who was an native of Sebasteia in Armenia, and his name was Patrick. He was a very great age, claiming to be one hundred and thirteen, very humble and given to silence. The fathers of that place told us that this virtuous elder had once been higou- men of the community at Abazan: he had abandoned that position for fear of the judgement. It was for great men to shepherd the spiritual sheep, he said; so he came here and put himself under obedience. He thought this would be more beneficial to his soul.
