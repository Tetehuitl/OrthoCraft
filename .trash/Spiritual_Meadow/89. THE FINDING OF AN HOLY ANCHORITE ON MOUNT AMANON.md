[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
One of the fathers in Theoupolis told us: We once went up into Mount Amanon for some reason or other and I found a cave. When I went in, I found and anchorite, kneeling down and with his hands stretched out to heaven. The hair of his head reached down to the floor. Thinking that he was alive, I made an act of obeisance before him saying: ‘Pray for me, father’. As he made no reply, I got up and went close to him, intending to embrace him, When I touched him I found that he was dead, so I left him and went out. A little further on I saw another cave. This I entered and found an elder. He said to me: ‘Welcome, brother; have you seen the other elder’s cave?” "Yes, father’ I said in reply, and he said to me: ‘Did you get anything there?’ to which I replied ‘No’. He said to me: ‘Naturally brother, for the elder has been dead for fifteen years’. Yet he was as though he had died only an hour before. The monk offered a prayer for me and I went my way, glorifying God.
