This same Abba Athanasios said: ‘Our fathers maintained self- discipline and indifference to worldly goods, but we have lined well both our bellies and our purses’.  
 
Again: ‘In our fathers’ time it was very important to avoid distractions. Now our cooking pot and our handwork rule us’.  
 
He also told us this: One day, this thought came into my mind: what difference does it make whether we fight the fight agdaizein or not? I fell as though into a trance and one came who said to me: ‘Follow me’. He led me into a place filled with light and stood me before a door, the beauty of which was beyond description. We were hearing what sounded like an innumerable multitude within, praising God. We knocked and somebody inside heard us and cried: “What do you want?’ My guide replied: ‘We want to come in’, The other answered, saying to me: ‘Nobody comes in here who lives negligently ea ameleiai. If you want to come in, go and fight the fight, holding nothing to be of any account in the vain world’.
