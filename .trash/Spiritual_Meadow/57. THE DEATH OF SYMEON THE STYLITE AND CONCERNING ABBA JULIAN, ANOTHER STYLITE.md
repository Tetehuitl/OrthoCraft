[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Four miles from the city of Egaion a stylite was installed whose name was Symeon. He was struck by lightening and died. Abba Julian the stylite whose pillar was on the Gulf of Alexan- dretta? told his disciples to burn incense, not at the accustomed time. The disciples said to him: ‘Tell us why, father’, He said to them: ‘Because brother Symeon of Aigaion has been struck by lightening and is dead. Behold, his soul is departing with great gladness’. They were twenty-four miles from each other.
