There are many artists whose works fall into the same categories as those of Picasso and Millais. Fortunately the imitation of the skill and art knowledge that made possible the productions of Millais, could only be attempted by persons possessing similar talents and skill that had resulted from years of hard study and practice. It was not so with Picasso’s productions after his eschewal of realism. The merest novice may now by-pass all ordinary art study and with effrontery, because of Picasso and others, claim protection for anything he cares to do, with full support of bewildered press representatives. Hence there are legions of imposters who vie with each other to attract attention to their eccentricities and vulgarities. — location: [325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DGBMMPG&location=325)
