Some fathers told us about Abba Leontios the Cilician who served devotedly on the staff of the New Church of our Lady Mary, the holy Mother of God. For about forty years he never came out of that church; he was always deep in thought and always kept his own counsel. They also told us this about him: that if he saw an indigent coming towards him, if it was a blind man he would give him something into his hand. But if it were one who could see, Abba Leontios would put the coins before the man, perhaps on the base of a column, on a seat or maybe on the sanctuary steps and the poor man would take them from there himself. When an elder asked why he did not give them into the hand of a beggar he answered: ‘Forgive me father, but it is not I who gives. It is my lady the Mother of God who provides for both me and for them.’
