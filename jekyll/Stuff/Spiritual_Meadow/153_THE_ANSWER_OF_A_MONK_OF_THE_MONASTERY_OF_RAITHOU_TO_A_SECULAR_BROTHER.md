There were two brothers living in the world, at Constantinople, who were very devout and much given to fasting. One of them came to Raithou where he renounced the world and became a monk. Some time later, his brother (who stil] lived in the world) came to Raithou to see his brother, now become a monk. Whilst he was staying  
 
there, the worldly brother saw the monastic brother taking refresh- ment at the ninth hour. He was offended and said to his brother: ‘Brother, when you were in the world, you never took refreshment before sun-set’. Then the monk said to him: ‘In truth, brother, when I was in the world I received sustenance through my ears; for vain- glory and the praise of men sustained me in no small way and eased the discomfort of the austerity’.
