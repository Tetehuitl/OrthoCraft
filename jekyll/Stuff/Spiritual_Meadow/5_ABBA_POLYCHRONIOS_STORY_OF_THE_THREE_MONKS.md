Abba Polychronios told us: I saw one of the brothers at the Lavra of the Towers of Jordan who was not keeping himself up to the mark; for he never fulfilled his Sunday duties. Then, some time later, I saw this man who had formerly been so lax devoting himself to his duties with all diligence and great zeal. So I said to him: ‘Now you are doing well, brother, and looking after your own soul’. He said to me: ‘Abba, I am about to die sir’,—and three days later he was dead.  
 
This same Polychronios, priest of the New Lavra, also told me this: Once whilst I was staying at the Lavra of the Towers one of the brothers died. The steward said to me: ‘Of your charity, brother, come so we can carry that brother’s effects into the storeroom’, As we began to move his things I saw the steward weeping. I said to him: ‘Come now, abba, why are you weeping in this way, sir’? He replied: ‘Because today I am carrying out that brother’s effects and two days from now others shall bear away mine’. And so it was; two days later the steward himself died, just as he said.
