# On the St Benedict Medal

*For the early Christians, the cross was a favorite symbol and badge of their faith in Christ. From the writings of St. Gregory the Great (540-604), we know that St. Benedict had a deep faith in the Cross and worked miracles with the sign of the cross. This faith in, and special devotion to, the Cross was passed on to succeeding generations of Benedictines. Devotion to the Cross of Christ also gave rise to the striking of medals that bore the image of St. Benedict holding a cross aloft in his right hand and his Rule for Monasteries in the other hand. Thus, the Cross has always been closely associated with the Medal of St. Benedict, which is often referred to as the Medal-Cross of St. Benedict.*

*In the course of time, other additions were made, such as the Latin petition on the margin of the medal, asking that by St. Benedict’s presence, we may be strengthened in the hour of death, as will be explained later.*

*We do not know just when the first medal of St. Benedict was struck. At some point in history a series of capital letters was placed around the large figure of the cross on the reverse side of the medal. For a long time the meaning of these letters was unknown, but in 1647 a manuscript dating back to 1415 was found at the Abbey of Metten in Bavaria, giving an explanation of the letters. They are the initial letters of a Latin prayer of exorcism against Satan, as will be explained below.*

### FRONT OF THE MEDAL

- Above the chalice and the raven in the center, on either side of Saint Benedict:
    - Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti (Cross of the Holy Father Benedict)
    - Words around the perimeter of the medal:
        - Ejus in obitu nro praesentia muniamur (May we at our death be fortified by his presence)

### BACK OF THE MEDAL

- Initials on the cross in the center:
    - C. S. S. M. L.: Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux (The Holy Cross be my light)
    - N. D. S. M. D.: Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux (Let not the dragon be my guide)
    - Circles by the four corners of the cross:
        - C S P B: Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti (Cross of the Holy Father Benedict)
    - Initials around the perimeter:
        - V R S N S M V - S M Q L I V B: Vade Retro Satana, Nunquam Suade Mihi Vana—Sunt Mala Quae Libas, Ipse Venena Bibas (Step back, Satan, do not suggest to me thy vanities —evil are the things thou profferest, drink thou thy own poison)
    - And at the top:
        - Pax (Peace)
