### Baby out with the bath water

With most things that are incorrect and espoused by the Roman Catholic Church they are not completely incorrect. We cannot Throw out the doctrine of the assumption of the Theotokos bodily into heaven or we would reject the authentic orthodox teaching of the church. What is disputed in this particular case is only a detail and its natural consequences. We reject their assertion that she did not die before her body was taken to heaven. Also we cannot completely reject the concept of merits. The fathers both east and west refer to them. St. Benedict in his rule comes to mind. Also, a story of a young monk who let his elder sleep instead of seeking his own comfort seven times through the night and by doing this earned himself seven heavenly crowns.
