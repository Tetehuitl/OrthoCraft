# Lists MOC
 This is a "reminders" list. It can also be a "Greatest Hits" or "Best of" list. 
 
 Use it to compile anything you find notable—and worthy of remembering. It can link to a final product, or just to a journal entry that continues to strongly resonate with me in some important way.
 
 > "Many of the best ideas are the ones we've already had—we just need the *reminder*. And most of the time we already know what to do—we just need the *reminder*."

## Commentary
One cure to mental anxiety is just reconnecting with your past thoughts. Remember the things you've done, discovered, realized, synthesized, created, and otherwise experienced. That's what this super list can help with.
