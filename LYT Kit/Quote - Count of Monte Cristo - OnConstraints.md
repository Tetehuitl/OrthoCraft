> Dantes asks, "What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?” The wise Abbe replies, *"Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies. Captivity brings light to the treasures of the human intellect, just as compression is needed to explode gunpowder. From the collision of clouds electricity is produced; from electricity, lightning; from lightning, illumination."* - from The Count of Monte Cristo

### Notes
Captivity, compression, collision... concentration, density, tightly-packed

light, spark, explode, electricity, lightning, illumination

The tightly-packed collision of clouds produces intense electricity in the form of lightning; and from lightning comes illumination. The same is true for ideas.
