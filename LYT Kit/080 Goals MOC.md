### Commentary on goal setting
I’ve come to understand that my "gameplans" often become "reviews" as well. It feels more holistic so I lean into it. To that point, I don't like following one rigid template; it's less fun. So I'll pick and choose from a bunch of templates I've picked up over the years.

*"Wisdom is nothing more profound than the ability to follow your own advice."* SH

The acts of "reflection" & "direction" are two different thought processes that have a lot of overlap. Reflection ties us to the past. Direction ties us to the future. It's a form of personal "R&D".
