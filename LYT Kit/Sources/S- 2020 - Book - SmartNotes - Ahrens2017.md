This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 2 · Location 134

Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 3 · Location 158

The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 5 · Location 176

self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2)–and the environment can be changed.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 5 · Location 179

Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 5 · Location 180

not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.

1 Everything You Need to Know

“I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.”

*NOTE* - Page 5 · Location 189

This conjures not being driven by a task list

A good structure enables flow,

students, researchers and nonfiction writers,

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 7 · Location 211

But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/ writing/ note-taking (there is research on that: cf. Chapter 1.3). Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 7 · Location 222

Good students also look beyond the obvious. They peek over the fences of their own disciplines–and once you have done that, you cannot go back and do what everyone else is doing, even if you now must deal with heterogeneous ideas that come without a manual on how they might fit together. All that means is that a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 8 · Location 239

insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.

1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 9 · Location 248

They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.

*NOTE* - Page 9 · Location 250

Need to be able to counter this... how the imf doesn’t restrict connectiveness.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 9 · Location 252

The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015).

*NOTE* - Page 9 · Location 253

Look into this research paper

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 9 · Location 257

It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on.

ever able to get anything done before. Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010). Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 10 · Location 272

The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001).

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 11 · Location 281

Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition. We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research (cf. Ahrens, 2014, 134f.).

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 11 · Location 284

Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more open manner. The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete “next steps.” Of course, insightful writing or academic work is also done one step at a time, but these are most often too small to be worth writing down (looking up a footnote, rereading a chapter, writing a paragraph) or too grand to be finished in one go. It is also difficult to anticipate which step has to be taken after the next one. You might notice a footnote, which you check quickly on. You try to understand a paragraph and need to look up something for clarification. You make a note, go back to reading and then jump up to write down a sentence that formed itself in your mind.

*NOTE* - Page 11 · Location 290

Yes very well said

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 11 · Location 290

Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level. Zooming out to the bigger picture does not really help, either, because then we have next steps like “writing a page.” That does not really help with navigating the things you have to do to write a page, often a whole bunch of other things that can take an hour or a month. One has to navigate mostly by sight. These are probably the reasons why GTD never really caught on in academia, although it is very successful in business and has a good reputation among the self-employed.

*NOTE* - Page 11 · Location 295

Yes so nice to read this because I knew gtd was a mistake for the majority of my purposes

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 11 · Location 295

What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 12 · Location 304

writing, learning and thinking.

The three actions he’s sinking to help

1.2 The Slip - box

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 13 · Location 322

His slip-box became his dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. And it was fun to work with–because it worked.

*NOTE* - Page 13 · Location 324

Dialogue partner to describe ZK. And fun. I jive with his emphasis on fun

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 14 · Location 347

While some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 15 · Location 363

His productivity is, of course, impressive. But what is even more impressive than the sheer number of publications or the outstanding quality of his writing is the fact that he seemed to achieve all this with almost no real effort. He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)\[ 4\]

*NOTE* - Page 16 · Location 368

It’s quite apparent he entered the flow zone

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 16 · Location 374

The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned–which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work.

*NOTE* - Page 16 · Location 379

Flow, no task manager, and insight-oriented writing

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 16 · Location 380

If we work in an environment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, we don’t need to struggle with resistance. Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998).

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 17 · Location 389

successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 18 · Location 403

it is simple.

1.3 The slip - box manual

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 18 · Location 416

Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.

*NOTE* - Page 18 · Location 417

Imdex and Maps to a degree

*NOTE* - Page 19 · Location 432

Metaphors to think about later: translator, mediator

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 19 · Location 438

If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23.

*NOTE* - Page 19 · Location 438

Folgezettel. Maps can replace this for the most part

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 20 · Location 441

Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them.

*NOTE* - Page 20 · Location 442

Direct links

*NOTE* - Page 20 · Location 446

I’m curious

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 20 · Location 449

The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.

We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.

Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (pink) - Page 22 · Location 494

Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (pink) - Page 23 · Location 496

If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen \[...\] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research. Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270) If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. Richard Feynman stresses it as much as Benjamin Franklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?

**HIGHLIGHT** - (pink) - Page 23 · Location 505

Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.

2.1 Writing a paper step by step

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 23 · Location 513

Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 24 · Location 514

If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box.

*NOTE* - Page 24 · Location 516

Good awareness and non rigidity

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 24 · Location 521

(ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant)

*NOTE* - Page 24 · Location 522

Doesn’t have to be EOD, sleep on it, so fresh in morning if that’s your style

**HIGHLIGHT** - (pink) - Page 24 · Location 523

The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?

*NOTE* - Page 24 · Location 525

Yes this is the juicy thinking

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 24 · Location 525

Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes from step one and put the literature notes from step two into your reference system. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into the slip-box.

*NOTE* - Page 24 · Location 528

These are a lot of the steps I don’t have time to type myself, but they are good

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 536

Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.

*NOTE* - Page 25 · Location 539

Sure sounds like a MOC good to know I’m in good thinking Company. Gives me confidence that my works ant are valuable and people need this

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 539

Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you. Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have. Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch–you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed–that is what insight does.

*NOTE* - Page 25 · Location 548

All great stuff

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 550

(most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order),

*NOTE* - Page 25 · Location 551

If you have some Mocs

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 26 · Location 561

We cannot help but think about more than one question at a time and the chances are that you will think and write in the future as well. It might not be for academia or a publication, but certainly for your own intellectual growth.

*NOTE* - Page 26 · Location 563

Love the emphasis on intellectual growth

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 571

Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 577

you will still encounter a lot of other ideas and information along the way. Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.

*NOTE* - Page 27 · Location 580

Accidental encounters as learning moments

3 Everything You Need to Have

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 611

overarching workflow

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 612

Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.

*NOTE* - Page 29 · Location 613

Individual notes should not have Front Matter, just back matter. Maps can have Front Matter flour faster navigation

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 613

external scaffold

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 615

That is pretty much it. To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter.

3.1 The Tool Box

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 30 · Location 629

whenever and wherever they pop into your head.

*NOTE* - Page 30 · Location 630

Use drafts , set up \_inbox or ingest folder as distinct from \_Daily Folger as distinct from \_Incubation folders

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 30 · Location 641

In that case, just give the notes a standardised title like “AuthorYear” and keep them in alphabetical order in one place.

*NOTE* - Page 30 · Location 642

4 A Few Things to Keep in Mind

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 32 · Location 665

Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.\[ 11\]

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 34 · Location 681

Luhmann’s formula for successful learning, writing and research.

5 Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 35 · Location 697

First, the task to write is given, then there is the challenge to find a topic or a specific angle on a problem, the research to do, starting with the collection of the relevant literature, followed by reading the material, processing it and coming to a conclusion. Writing is what follows: In the beginning stands the question to be answered, followed by an overview of the literature, the discussion of it and the conclusion. This, according to this thinking, prepares you for doing independent research. Alas, it does not. If you become successful in your research, it was not because you learned to approach writing in this way, but despite it.

*NOTE* - Page 35 · Location 702

Wow high school process so much different than organic process

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 36 · Location 715

It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing.

*NOTE* - Page 36 · Location 716

Like a screenplay

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 37 · Location 727

Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you “should” learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through whenever you try to write them down and connect them with your previous knowledge. It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything.

*NOTE* - Page 37 · Location 734

Another good argument for a writing mindset

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 37 · Location 734

You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about.

**HIGHLIGHT** - (yellow) - Page 38 · Location 738

Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.

*NOTE* - Page 38 · Location 741

Map-writing or mapping ideas in relation to one another has the same positive effects as writing: it focuses Thoughts finds holes in arguments etc
