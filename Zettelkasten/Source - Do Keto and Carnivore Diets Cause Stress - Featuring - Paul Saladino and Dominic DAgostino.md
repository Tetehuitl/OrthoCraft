        - [[Claim|➡]]: [[Stress]] is anything that interferes with the oxidation of sugar and the use of oxigen. i.e. breathless exercise and suppressing Thyroid function and under\*producing CO2 [[Hans Selye]] TS: 1:11

        - [[Claim|➡]]: [[Keto]] & [[Carnivore]] proponents tend not to have a functional model of [[Stress]]. TS: 1:40
        - [[Claim|➡]]: [[Keto]] & [[Carnivore]] diets can improve health by:
            1. Removing hundreds of irritants from food additives
            1. Removing Grains, bean, starches, under-cooked vegetables. That all promote endotoxin production in the gut
            1. Obtaining adequate protein. many people get less than 50g daily
            1. Eliminating [[PUFA]] & replacing it with [[Saturated Fat]]
            1. Removing unneeded supplements which may be doing harm
            1. Becoming proactive about health which has benefits in itself
            1. including "supplement-like" foods with less restrictive diets: Beef liver, oysters, gelatinous cuts of meat
        - [[Claim|➡]]: [[Metabolism]] is determined by the food we eat. The production of [[ATP]] is the main factor of health. The [[Mitochondria]] call the shots TS 8:40
        - [[Claim|➡]]: The liver is the energetic sensor of the organism. Predominate place active thyroid hormone T3 is produced by conversion from [[Thyroxine]]. When glycogen is depleted that process slows down and reverse T3 is increased. Thus slowing down the system and creating a hibernation state. This is not ideal. [[Raymond Pearl]]'s [[Rate of Living]] hypothesis is in opposition to this. TS 9:30
        - [[Claim|➡]]: A decrease in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals reduce tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone in order to go longer on less. [[W Donner Denckla]] TS 12:40
        - [[Claim|➡]]: Fat cannot be mobilized without activating the fat mobilizing systems. The fat mobilization system is the stress system. TS 13:40
        - [[Claim|➡]]: High cholesterol is a marker of high cortisol. It's an indicator of stress. TS ?17:25
        - [[Claim|➡]]: Blood labs are subjectively read by the [[Keto]] community. They let things slide based on speculations like: What would our ancestors have done? TS ?17:27
        - [[Claim|➡]]: Thyroid levels conversely correlate to Cholesterol levels. [[Cholesterol]] is converted in to [[Pregnenolone]], [[Progesterone]], & [[DHEA]] in the presence of [[Thyroid]]. Danny's sites his own levels. And other people's he's coached. TS 15:35
        - [[Claim|➡]]: [[Keto]] & [[Carnivore]] advocates are limited in their approach and only talk about [[mTOR]], insulin, [[Autophagy]] and other "pet concepts" that promote their way of thinking. TS 16:10
        - [[Claim|➡]]: People will look for other diets in 2-5 years just like vegans do after a number of years. This will always happen when the rate of [[Metabolism]] is not considered as fundamental to the diet. TS 16:50

    - Chapter 1 Summary
        - [[Keto]] & [[Carnivore]] diets draw incorrect conclusions because they have too limited an understanding of [[Metabolism]].
