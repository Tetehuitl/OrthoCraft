### A claim is:
- An assertion made by a [[Source]] (very rarely can be sourceless, if it's something I am very sure of but can't remember where I learned it).
- Can be assembled into [[Synthesis]]es .
- If you're referring to a claim a lot you it should be marked with a source, but most claims aren't used anywhere and I want low friction to creating them, so you may just have to look it up in the references.
- Should have a kindle loc, page number, or other identifier in the title.
    - On the page would be more aesthetic, but this is faster to create and speed is the higher priority
    - If you're using page numbers for a PDF, be sure to note on the [[Source]] page whether it's the PDF page number or internal page number (which starts after the table of contents and perhaps the preface).
