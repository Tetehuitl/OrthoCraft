without the will of the Lord, we neither get sick nor die. Therefore, flee far away from us, O lack of faith. — location: [1801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1801)

My child, believe that for everything that we may be suffering, Christ is an excellent Physician of both the soul and the body. Just have complete self-denial, perfect faith, and devotion to Him without hesitation. — location: [1819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1819)

Since our sweet Jesus is so good, compassionate, and kind, why should you despair? We seek one small thing from Him, and He gives us so much. We ask for one beam of light, and He gives us Himself as all Light, Truth, and Love. So humble yourself and rest all your hope in Him. — location: [1821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1821)

it is also a great struggle for one to bear all the burdens of the world today, when everyone demands that his neighbor fulfills all the commandments, while ignoring them himself. — location: [1833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1833)

You are clay; don’t be haughty. You are mud; you deserve to be used as plaster for walls in the outhouse. Don’t hate, don’t grumble, don’t backbite the other clay. For all of us are fit for plaster. — location: [1886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1886)

The grace of monastics benefits up to seven generations of their family, and many are saved through us, if our life is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore, we must struggle until death with patience and obedience. — location: [1915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1915)

One time, I saw the priest who baptized all of us back in our village. He was a holy man. He lived in virginity and gave many alms. In my sleep he said to me, “When I was alive I thought that only Liturgies free souls from Hades. But now that I have died, I indeed see that the prayers you say also pull out condemned souls.” Therefore, do not cease praying for departed souls, for the merciful God looks for a reason and an opportunity to save a soul. — location: [1918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1918)

The Holy Fathers say, “Pride goeth before a fall, and humility before grace.” — location: [1957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1957)

Humility is, when the other person is at fault, for us to do a metanoia to him saying, “Forgive me, my brother, I am sorry!” before he has time to seek forgiveness. This should not seem difficult and burdensome to you. It is nothing in comparison to what Christ the Master did for us. — location: [1998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=1998)

When you humble yourself, everyone will seem saintly to you; when you are proud, everyone will seem bothersome and bad. — location: [2002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2002)

I have seen in practice what I am telling you. There is no sacrifice to God more fragrant than chastity of the body which is obtained with a bloody and dreadful struggle. — location: [2008](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2008)

I cannot describe to you how much our Panagia likes chastity and purity. Since she is the only pure Virgin, she wants and loves everyone to be like that. As soon as we cry out to her she rushes to our help. You don’t even finish saying, “All-holy Theotokos, help me!” and at once, like lightning, she shines through the nous and fills the heart with illumination. She draws the nous to prayer and the heart to Love. Many times the entire night passes in tears and sweet cries, singing praises to her and especially to Him Whom she carries. — location: [2019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2019)

---
learn this: with love towards Christ and the Panagia, you obtain more watchfulness and theoria than with other struggles. Everything else is also good, when done properly, but love surpasses them all. — location: [2065](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2065)

Every thought that brings despair and heavy sorrow is from the devil. — location: [2102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2102)

A small sorrow mixed with joy, tears, and consolation in the soul is from the grace of God. — location: [2104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2104)

I do not know of anything else that pleases our sweet Jesus and His All-pure Mother more than chastity and virginity. Whoever desires to enjoy their great love should see to it that he makes his soul and body pure and chaste. Thus will he receive every heavenly good. — location: [2130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2130)

It takes extreme fasting so that the primeval blood leaves and the phlegm—that filth—is cleansed. The predispositions that one has grown accustomed to since childhood must be obliterated. Fasting must also be coupled with perpetual vigils. Not once or twice, but constantly so that the slothful and fat nous is made thin. Furthermore, it must be accompanied by ceaseless prayer—with the nous, lips, and heart. — location: [2640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2640)

---
Just as man dies when he stops breathing, so, too, does the soul die without continuous and endless prayer. It dies because that living flesh which is beginning to be conceived by the perpetuity of the prayer falls asleep, and the passions are rejuvenated. For the enemy does not sleep, but fights continuously. — location: [2643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2643)

of Athens, and see how many teachers—Origen and thousands of others—were at first great luminaries of the Church possessing extensive learning. But since they gave themselves over to the sea of knowledge before receiving in hesychia the purification of their senses and the peace and tranquillity of the Spirit, they sank in the ocean of the Holy Scriptures. They thought that their scholarly learning was sufficient. Thousands were lost and anathematized by the Councils, of which they had previously been champions. Read and you will see. — location: [2886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2886)

I found here a haven of stillness; Be healthy, my soul and my body; Swim, O my nous, in the sweetest tranquility, and ask not at all what your neighbor is doing. — location: [2909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2909)

---
See to it that you help yourself as much as you can. Take control of your appetite: don’t eat things that you know are harmful to your health: fried foods, salty foods, sauces, pork, meats, salted fish, alcoholic beverages in general. Avoid all these things, and it will be considered to be fasting in the eyes of the Lord. — location: [2934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=2934)

If a stone does not strike against another stone, no spark is produced. An untried man is completely worthless. — location: [3087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3087)

there is no such thing as a place without temptation. A person needs to win in the place where he is being fought, so as to bring sorrow and shame to the devil, and joy and glory to God. — location: [3099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3099)

Prayer of the heart is not susceptible to delusion, unless one is passionate and already deluded. — location: [3125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3125)

I have never seen a soul make progress in the prayer without frank confession of secret thoughts. — location: [3137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3137)

What does the Lord say? “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”156 He does not say, “Blessed are those who see visions and revelations.” — location: [3145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3145)

---
let each one of us, both young and old, with every word we say, with every step we take, at every moment of night and day, examine if perhaps we do, say, or think something that is not pleasing to Christ. I wonder, are we always worthy when we approach to commune Christ? I wonder, do we walk in imitation of Him? I wonder, does our sweet Jesus remain within us? Does he find a place in our pure heart, or does He depart immediately? — location: [3190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3190)

God, Who puts up with you the sinner. Now that He has awakened you with His grace, you don’t want to put up with your weak brother. So where is your justice? And what if Christ takes His grace away from you and demands the ten thousand talents you owe?161 What hast thou, ungrateful man, that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory every day as if thou hadst not received it? — location: [3203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3203)

---
There is no good thing that does not come from God, nor is there any bad thing that does not come from the devil. So don’t ever get the idea that you have done something good without God, because as soon as you think like that, immediately grace will withdraw, and you will lose it so that you realize your weak condition and learn the adage “know thyself.” In order for one to realize his weak nature, he must encounter many great temptations. And then, through many trials he is humbled and learns true humility. But it takes time. Humility does not consist of simple words such as “I am a sinner…” and so on. Humility is the truth. To learn that you are nothing. Nothing is what existed before God created everything: nothing. So this nothing is what we are. Your root, your existence began with nothing, and your mother is clay, but your Creator is God. “What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?”171 It is a great gift of God for one to learn the truth. And the Lord said that this truth frees us from sin.172 — location: [3427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3427)

And besides all of these causes, it could be due to the devil’s hatred. When he sees that we want to be saved, he becomes an obstacle and stumbling block to hinder our good intentions, to give us despair, disbelief, despondency, and illness due to the grief and great pain, to dry us up like flowers suddenly hit by a gust of wind from the south. — location: [3516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3516)

Bodily labor, when it is done in moderation and does not cause agitation, is very beneficial: it leads you to humility. — location: [3678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01E64OTKC&location=3678)
