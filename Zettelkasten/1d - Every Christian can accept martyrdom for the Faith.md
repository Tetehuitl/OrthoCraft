- # Notes:
    - Being Orthodox doesn't mean that we are correct and argue with everyone. However, there is a time and place for that. To be Orthodox is to be martyrs. We won't get to heaven by being correct.

    - **REFLECTION**
    - Every Christian can accept martyrdom for the Faith for himself,
 in times of persecution as well as in times of peace. Abba Athanasius 
says: "Be tortured by your conscience, die to sin, mortify your earthly 
members, and you will be a martyr in accordance with your wishes. The 
martyrs fought with emperors and princes; you have the king of sins--the
 devil and the demonic princes. Before, there were idols, pagan temples,
 and those who offer sacrifice to the idols. And now, they exist as 
thoughts in the soul. He who is a slave to debauchery worships the idol 
of Aphrodite. He who becomes angry and enraged worships the idol of 
Ares. He who is avaricious and ignores the pain and misery of his 
neighbor worships the idol Hermes. If you refrain from all of this and 
preserve yourself from passions, you have overcome idols, you have 
rejected an evil belief and have become a martyr for the true Faith." 
Therefore, a man need not especially yearn for persecution and 
martyrdom. Everyone in every age can endure martyrdom for the sake of 
Christ and His Gospel.
