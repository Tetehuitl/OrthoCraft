    - Chapter 1
        - [[Claim|➡]] Heaven is incomprehensibly wonderful. We forget this for two reasons: one, because we think we won't make it, two, we are ignorant of it. pg 3
        - [[Quote|❝]] "Everything will pass and will end as if had never existed, whereas works done in God will remain with the soul that worked them so that the worker may reap eternal life from them."
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Blessed are they who work now so they may reap their reward in heaven. pg 4
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) There is no suffering in this life that can out do the joys of the next. pg 4
        - [❝]([[Quote]]) "The grandeur of man, whom God raises to such heights and glory, is unrivaled! Yet we passionate sinners are unaware of and indifferent to these great riches, and our way of thinking is completely earthly. Just think: this body which is fetid dirt is counted worthy to be conformed to God's glory, to become angelic!" pg 4
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Men are material compared to [[Angels]] and angels are somewhat material compared to God. So, the more Godlike we become the more angelic, so to speak. pg 5

        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Earthly joy is followed by sorrow, but heavenly joy is unending. pg 6
        - [❝]([[Quote]]) "See what beauty awaits us! If you could only see how beautiful it is! You would disregard everything; you would even become like trash to be stepped on, just as long as you would not be deprived of everything that the sweet love of Jesus has prepared!"
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Heavenly beauty far surpasses any earthly beauty. We cannot even fathom the beauty of heaven. pg 7
    - Chapter 1 Summary
        - [☩]([[Crux]]) This life will end and the only thing we can bring with us to the next life is the works we do in God. Heaven is more beautiful than we can imagine, so we should not neglect the work we must do to get there.

        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Faith, hope and patience is how Christ showed us to endure suffering and affliction. pg 10

But we, who believe in the living God and whose hopes depend upon Him, ought to rejoice that we have such a Father in the heavens, Who loves us more than all fathers and mothers and Who takes infinite care to render us worthy of Him." pg 12
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) We shouldn't grieve that we sin many times, we are men of clay and are inclined toward evil from our youths, because out good intentions will prevail and God has given us the tools we need to overcome our nature and has saved us by his [[Cross]] and [[Resurrection]]. pg 12
        - [➡]([[Claim]]) Grief is good when it spurs us to be courageous and put of the armor of righteousness. pg 12
