## Notes:

- We lose track of our goals easily and need to constantly be reminded of who we are supposed to be and how we are supposed to act. We should read Divine Scripture daily to remind us that we need to rid ourselves of the passions by seeing the virtue portrayed as living statues in the saints depicted.
- > The study of inspired Scripture is the chief way of finding our duty, for in it we find both instruction about conduct and the lives of blessed men, delivered in writing, as some breathing images of godly living, for the imitation of their good works. Hence, in whatever respect each one feels himself deficient, devoting himself to this imitation, he finds, as from some dispensary, the due medicine for his ailment. Loc 560,215
- > Thus, generally, as painters, when they are painting from other pictures, constantly look at the model, and do their best to transfer its lineaments to their own work, so too must he who is desirous of rendering himself perfect in all branches of excellency, keep his eyes turned to the lives of the saints as though to living and moving statues, and make their virtue his own by imitation. Loc 560,224
