## Notes:

- To interrogate without earnestness
- To Answer without desire of display
- Not to interrupt a profitable speaker
- Not to ambitiously desire to put a word in
- To be measured in speaking and hearing
- Not to be ashamed of receiving
- Not to be grudging in giving information
- Not to pass other's knowledge as one's own
- The middle tone of voice is best (not too low or too high-pitched)
- To think before you speak
- To be courteous when addressed
- To be amiable in social intercourse (not aiming to be pleasant by facetiousness but cultivate gentleness in kind admonitions)
- Harshness is ever to be put aside even in censuring (The more you show modesty and humility the more likely you will be acceptable to the patient who needs your treatment)
- There are times when rebukes are necessary (like the prophet to David, suggesting an imaginary character made the sinner judge his own sin, and by condemning himself found no fault in the one who convicted him)
