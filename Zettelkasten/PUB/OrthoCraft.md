*Play Minecraft and other game with Orthodox people*
    
## Server Setup
 - Server side Mods installed
    - **[Adorn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adorn)** is a decoration and furniture mod that adds many decoration blocks 
    - **[Fabric-Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)** is a mod for vanilla Minecraft that allows you to take full control of what matters from a technical perspective of the game.
    - **[carpet-autoCraftingTable](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-autoCraftingTable)** is an extension for carpet-mod. Implementation based on Skyrising's implementation for autoCraftingTable for QuickCarpet - implemented here as an extension for fabric-carpet mod. *When enabled, all crafting tables will contain block entites making them immovable. This means that items will also be stored inside the crafting table.*
    - **[Carpet-Extra](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra)** Extra Features for Carpet Mod.
    - **[DisFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/disfabric)** A simple but complete Fabric <> Discord chat bridge.
    - **[Gunpowder](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-mc)** Gunpowder aims to provide an all-in-one API for your server modding needs. While designed for servers, it does work in singleplayer too, as do all of our official modules.
    - **[Gunpowder Currency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-currency)** This mod is an extension for [Gunpowder](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-mc) to provide money, and commands to pay between users.
    - **[Gunpowder Market](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-market)** This mod is an extension for [Gunpowder](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-mc) to provide a GUI market. Also requires [Gunpowder Currency](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gunpowder-currency)
    - **[Flan](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flan)** allows you to create and manage claims on your minecraft world. With commands, gui and world interactions you can easily create and manage those. Flan is completly server side only meaning you could setup a fabric server with Flan and connect with a vanilla client and it will work just as fine.
    - **[INMIS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inmis)** I need more inventory storage... or space. I don't fully remember what the s stands for. Inmis is a backpack mod! It provides a progression ladder of 6 backpack types, plus 2 extras.
    - **[Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat)** This mod adds a proximity voice chat to your Minecraft server. You can choose between push to talk (PTT) or voice activation. The default PTT key is `CAPS LOCK`, but it can be changed in the controls. You can access the voice chat settings by pressing the `V` key.
- Client side Mods Installed
    - **[Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap)** Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a circle-shaped minimap and a separate setting for locking the minimap's rotation (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including players, mobs and items, as dots with a custom color or as icons (usually heads). In addition to the default compass directions, you can place your own waypoints that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world. Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with optional teleportation. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (cave mode).
    - **[Xaero's World Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map)** adds a self-writing fullscreen map to your Minecraft client. Works as a separate mod but is a lot better with Xaero's Minimap. The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible.
    - **[Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items)** Clean and Customizable. An easy way to browse recipes.
