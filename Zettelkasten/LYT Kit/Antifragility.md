# Antifragility
*"If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."* 
- Getting **stronger from stressors**, more settled from shaking, more adaptable from attacks
- It's a kind of on-the-fly [[Natural Selection]]

### Wiki
Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. 

It's fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (i.e. the ability to recover from failure) and robustness (that is, the ability to resist failure). 

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

Domains: The concept has been applied in physics, risk analysis, molecular biology, transportation planning, engineering, aerospace, megaproject management, and computer science.

Background: Developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
