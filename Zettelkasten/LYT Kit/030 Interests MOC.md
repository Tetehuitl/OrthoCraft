#### Using the Dewey Decimal System
In case you were wondering, the above structure is a modified outline of the Dewey Decimal System. Despite some criticisms of the Dewey Decimal System, it's actually an excellent, pre-built, time-tested structure that works very well for structuring the interests of your digital library.

That said, there’s a reason this MOC is not called Dewey. It isn’t about the whole decimal system; it’s about your interests. We’re just using a basic, modified Dewey outline as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests.

### Commentary on an A-Z list of MOCs
For those that want to maintain an alphabetical "Map of Maps" list, here's an incomplete example of the MOCs from above. It's incomplete, and actually no longer perfectly alphabetical since I've changed some of the names...which is why you should just use #MOC for your alphabetical list instead.
