# The Process of Forging Evergreen Notes
 The below process delivers a built-in mechanism for:
 1. idea creation and connection
 2. the strengthening of note retrieval
 3. the productive/clever use of spaced repetition

### Make an Evergreen Note
- I pulled in this old note from my pre-Obsidian zettelkasten. I put it in a "Incubation" folder.
	- [[201502201713 Habit Concepts and Theory]]
- It's rough and less useful than it could be.
- I made a new note to work in, and eventually it became this:
	- [[The neural formation of habits is additive - v1]]
- Now I have an evergreen note.

### Add Note to MOC
- Cool but... I like to make my digital library robust with several avenues built-in to re-discover a note. I find this process of connecting to conceptual cousins further cements the new note into my memory. It sort of tethers it in place like a bug caught on a spider web. 
- So I linked that new evergreen note to a new MOC:
	- ![[Example - New Habits MOC]]
- See at the top of the note, how I have a link that leads back to [[010 Mindsets MOC]]? 
	- I like to make sure a new MOC is somehow linked back to one of my ≈10 Home maps. 
		- In this case, it's simple: `Habits MOC` » `Mind MOC`.
		- But it could have been: `Habits of High Achievers MOC` » `Habits MOC` » `Mind MOC`.
	- I do this because the ≈10 Home maps all link back to the Home note: [[000 Home]].
	- That means that very simply, I've created a practical star map that I can make hyperspace jumps between very quickly.
- Pretty awesome in my opinion.

### 3 Make more Evergreen Notes
- Creating one evergreen note oftentimes spawns new insights for more evergreen notes.
- That is what happened to me here. I immediately felt the need to add a related evergreen note. 
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive - v1]]
- I linked that note to the same Habits MOC I created above.
- Now my Habits MOC has two entries!
	- ![[Example 2 - New Habits MOC]]
- There's no need to organize more at this point.

### Success
Boom! That's it. This process delivers a built-in mechanism for idea creation and connection, the strengthening of note retrieval, and the productive/clever use of spaced repetition.
