# Evergreen note-making sharpens your thinking
Evergreen note-making forces clear, sharp think as you:

- figure out the key statement
- write the note in your own words
- relate the idea in the note to your personal experiences
- link the idea in the note to other ideas

Each aspect isn't a passive process; it's an active, engaged one.
