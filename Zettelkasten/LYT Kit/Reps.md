# Reps
*"Reps, Reps, Reps."*  

Learning, improving, deliberate practice…the underpinning of it all—the unspoken current flowing through any progression—is getting reps, in all forms, consistently and frequently.

In practicing a craft, just show up, and get reps: tiny reps, technical reps, reps from questions, reps by observation, reps by research, reps, reps, consistent, persistent reps!
