# Evergreen notes compound in value over time
When you follow a process for making Evergreen notes, you naturally develop insights that compound in value over time. See: [[Benefits of Linked Thinking]] and remember to [[Trust the Process]]. 

This is the result of the fact that [[Evergreen notes are antifragile]].

All things being equal, no sane person would put their money in a zero interest account, if they could put their money in an account with compounding interest (See [[The Compound Effect]]). So why do that with one of the most valuable assets you possess: the ability to effectively remember and utilize your life learnings and experience.
