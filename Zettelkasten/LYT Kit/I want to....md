# I want to...
- I want to get my bearings.
	- Either go to: [[000 Home|Home]] or [[085 Compass MOC|Compass]]
- I want to #journal in a new daily note (click on "Open today's note")
- I want to #process new #source material, adding my own #commentary.
	- From that processing, I want to make new notes.
- I want to further #develop (TK) half-formed blocks of atomic thoughts into fuller notes
- I want to forge, collide, and craft ideas in an #MOC note
- I want to navigate my existing spatial constellation of ideas. 
	- Either go to: [[030 Interests MOC|Interests]] or "Open graph view"
	- I just want to browse around and have fun. Same as above
- I want to review my timestamped notes 
	- (If you have hotkeys set up, you can go from day to day with a click. It's pretty awesome.)
- I want to be surprised (click on "Open random note")
