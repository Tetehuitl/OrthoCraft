# Shadow-Clone

_Divide your energies to accomplish more, at the cost of increasing your fragility, exposure, and vulnerability_

_Like multi-tasking_

To create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones:

Shadow clones can serve a number of purposes: They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity. Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone.

Shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses.

While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.

### How to Apply
The best way to deploy a shadow-clone is probably through leveraging apps to do work for you. Like transcribing audio notes for example.
