        - [[Claim]]: God is all good and transcendently good Pg 53
        - [[Claim]]: There are different kinds of beings created by him with free will: Pg 53
            - His friends (angels)
            - His true servants (anyone who exhausted themselves doing his will)
            - Some are worthless (those who think baptism is enough but have not been faithful)
            - Some are completely estranged from him (unbelievers or heretics)
            - Some feeble opponents (Those who reject God and fight against him, demons)
        - [[Claim]]: God belongs to all free beings equally. Just like the sun shines and seasons change for all equally. ""11. For there is no respect of persons with God."" [[Romans 2]] Pg 54
