- Notes:
    - Zettlekasten is German for a box of cards.
    - Two boxes are used:
        - Reference box
            -  bibliographic notes
            -  brief description
        - Main box
            -  new ideas
            -  insights
    - Note taking process:
        - Take [[Literature Notes]]
            -  write down information you wish to remember or find interesting on a card instead of highlighting.
            - must be brief (< 3 sentences)
            - must be in your own words
            - Include pages numbers for easier reference
        - Take [[Reference Notes]]
            - Write down relevant information on the author
            - Write down who told you about the source
            - Write a brief summary
        - Make [[Zettels]] **(most important step)**
            - Review literature notes 
            - Think about how they relate to your **thinking, interests, and research**.
            - focus on ''quality over quantity''. **The goal is to add usefulness to the notes.**
            - Try to find connections from what you just learned to what you already know.
    - Find keywords:
        - Instead of think which category a note falls into try to think of how you would want to stumble upon the note. Or when and how you will use the notes.
    - Take [[Thoughts]]: 
        - Take notes on ideas you have throughout the day and go over them to see if they can be turned into permanent notes.
        - review these notes soon so you don't forget their context.
    - Finding meaningful connections:
        - How does this fit into what I already know?
        - Can this be explained by something else?
        - What does X mean for Y?
