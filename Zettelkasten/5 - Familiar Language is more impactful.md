- !!Notes:
- When we use unfamiliar phrases and words like "he was afrighted" in writing, it doesn't have the same impact on us as if we used a familiar word or phrase. We can relate more to "he was afraid" because we have been afraid before and when asked to describe our experience we would say "I was afraid."
