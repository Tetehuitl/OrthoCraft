Abba Polychronius the priest also told us about another elder living in the same Lavra of Abba Peter who would often go off and stay on the banks of the holy Jordan. There he found a lion’s den in which he installed himself. One day he found two lion-cubs in the cave. Wrapping them up in his cloak, he took them to church. ‘If we kept the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ’, he said, ‘these animals would fear us. But because of our sins we have become slaves and it is rather we who fear them’, Greatly edified, the brethren returned to their caves.
