‘When we met Abba Eusebios, priest of the lavra at Raithou, he told that a demon once arrived at an elder’s cell disguised as a monk. He knocked at the door: the elder opened up to him and said: ‘Pray’. The demon said: ‘Now and for ever and unto the ages of ages, amen’, Three times the elder said: ‘Pray’, and each time the demon said: ‘Now and for ever and unto the ages of ages, amen’. The elder then said: ‘You are welcome if when you pray you say: “Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, now and for ever and unto the ages of ages, amen”, and when the elder said this, the demon disappeared as though it were pursued by fire’.
