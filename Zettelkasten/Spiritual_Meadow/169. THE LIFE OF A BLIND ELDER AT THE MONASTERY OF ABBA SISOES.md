[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
There was a blind elder at Soété in the lavra of Abba Sisoés; his cell was located about half a mile from the well. He would never allow anyone else to fetch water for him. He made a rope and attached one end of it to the well, the other to his cell; the rope lay on the ground. When he went to fetch water, he walked along the rope. The elder did this so that he could find the well that way. When the wind blew the sand so that it covered the rope, he would take it up in his hand, shake it and put it back down on the ground and walk along it. When a brother offered to fetch water for him, the elder replied: ‘Truly brother, for twenty-two years I have fetched my own water; so you wish to deprive me of my labour?”
