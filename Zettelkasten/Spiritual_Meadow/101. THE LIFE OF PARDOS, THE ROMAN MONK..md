The fathers of that same monastery told us about another elder who had been there and had recently died. His name was Abba Paul and he came from Rome. (As a young man he had been a muleteer.) One day he set out (for Jericho) with some mules. There was a small child at the inn whom, at the instigation of the devil and without the knowledge of Abba Paul a mule had trampled and killed. Deeply troubled by this, Abba Paul fled into the wilderness and arrived at Arona, where he became an anchorite. He continually lamented the death of the child, saying: ‘I put that child to death and it is as a murderer that I will have to stand at the judgement’. There was a lion nearby and, each day, Abba Paul would go into its den, teasing and provoking it to jump up and devour him—but the lion did him no harm whatsoever. When he realised that he was not succeeding, Abba Paul said to himself: ‘I will lie down on the lion’s path; then, when he comes on his way down to drink at the river, he will devour me’. He lay there and, after a little while, the lion came by. And, as though it were a human, it very carefully stepped over the elder without even touching him. Then the elder knew that God had forgiven him his sin. He came back to his monastery where he Jed an exemplary life (which greatly benefitted and edified everybody) until the day of his falling asleep in God.
