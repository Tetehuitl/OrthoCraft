At Terenuthis we met Abba Theodore of Alexandria. This elder said to us: ‘My child, it was by their nature that the monks lost Scété, just as the elder predicted. Believe this elder who speaks to you, children; amongst the Scetiotes there was great love, asceticism and discernment. I have seen elders there who never ate at all, unless somebody came that way. Amongst these there was an elder named Ammonios who lived close by me. Once I realised the way he lived, I used to visit him every Saturday so that, by my intervention, he would take some food. No matter at what hour visitors arrived for the purpose of prayer, it was the practice of those fathers, once they had offered their prayers, to set the table for them and immediately to eat some food’.
