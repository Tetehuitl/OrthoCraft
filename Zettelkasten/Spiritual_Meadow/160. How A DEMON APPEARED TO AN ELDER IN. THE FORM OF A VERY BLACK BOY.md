Abba Paul, higoumen of the monastery of Abba Theognias told us that a certain ascetic elder had said:  
 
One day I was sitting in my cell doing my handwork (I was plaiting baskets actually, and singing psalms) and see! What looked like a Saracen youth wearing a bread-basket came in through the window. He stood before me and began to dance. As I continued singing psalms, he said to me: ‘Elder, do I dance well?’ I answered not a word. He spoke again: ‘Do you like the way I dance, elder?” As I answered him no word whatsoever, he said to me: ‘Oh, wicked old man; why do you imagine you are doing something important? I tell you, you made a mistake in the sixty-fifth, the sixty-sixth and the sixty-seventh psalms.’ Then I stood up and prostrated myself before God: he disappeared at once. ᾿
