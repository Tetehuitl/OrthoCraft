Abba John the Cilician, higoumen of Raithou, said to his brethren: “Brethren: as we fled from the world, so let us flee from the desires of the flesh’.  
 
Again: ‘Let us be imitators of our fathers who lived here in such hardship skJ/éragdégia and recollection’.  
 
Again: ‘Children, let us not defile this place which our fathers cleansed of demons’.  
 
Again: ‘This is a place for ascetics, not for businessmen’.  
 
Again: ‘I have come across elders who lived for seventy years and never ate anything but grass and dates’.  
 
Again: ‘Seventy-six years I have lived in this place, suffering many awlul and wicked things from the demons’.
