By the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, there is no evil there. But this you must know, brother: that whoever celebrates the eucharist in your community, you have an elder there named Patrick. This elder stands outside the sanctuary, in the lowest place of all, close by the west wall of the church. This man says the eucharistic prayer for everybody and the holy sacrifice is reckoned to be his.
