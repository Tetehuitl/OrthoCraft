Abba Stephan Trichinas told us this too about Abba Julian the stylite. A lion appeared in the area and destroyed many people, strangers and natives. One day the elder called his disciple to him (the man’s name was Pancratios) and told him: ‘Go about two miles towards the north and you will find a lion in its Jair there. Say to it: “The lowly Julian says: In the name of Jesus Christ the son of the living God, withdraw from this land,”’ The brother went and found the lion in its Jair, He delivered the elder’s message, whereupon the lion immediately and without delay went away; and everybody glorified God.
