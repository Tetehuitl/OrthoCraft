Abba John, priest of the Monastery of the Eunuchs, told us that he had heard Abba Sisinios the anchorite say:  
 
One day I was in my cave near the holy Jordan and, as I was singing the third hour, a Saracen woman came that way and entered my cave. She sat herself down before me and took off her  
 
clothes. I was not distracted; I quietly completed the appointed office in the fear of God. Then, when I had finished, I said to her (in Hebrew): ‘Sit up and let me talk to you—and I will do whatever you wish’. She sat up and then I said to her: ‘Are you christian or pagan’? She said she was christian. ‘Do you not know that those who play the harlot go away into perdition?’ I asked, and she said she did. ‘Then why do you play the harlot?’ I asked. ‘Because I am hungry’, she replied. Then I said to her: ‘Stop playing the harlot and come here each day’—and I began giving her some of the food that God provided for me to eat, until I left those parts.
