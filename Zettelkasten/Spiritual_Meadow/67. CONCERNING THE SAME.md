Concerning this Abba Theodosios the solitary, Abba Cyriacos, his disciple, told us that he spent thirty-five years as a solitary fasting two days before he ate and keeping completely silent, speaking to nobody. If he said anything at all, he did it by signs. I saw this man myself in the Lavra of the Aliotes mentioned above, for I stayed there ten years.
