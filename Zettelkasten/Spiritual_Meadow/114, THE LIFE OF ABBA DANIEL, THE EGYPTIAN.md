On another occasion, the same elder told us this about Abba Daniel the Egyptian:  
 
One day, this elder went up to Terenuthis to sell what he had made with his hands. A young man entreated the elder, saying: ‘For the love of God, come into my house, good elder, and offer a prayer over my wife, for she is sterile’. The elder let himself be persuaded by the young man and went off into his house with him, He offered a prayer over the woman and (as it was the will of God that she should do so,) she became pregnant. Some men who did not fear God began to defame the elder and to say: ‘The truth of the matter is that the young man is sterile. It is by Abba Daniel that the woman is pregnant.’ This rumour came to the ears of the elder and he told the woman's husband to let him know when she had her  
 
child. So when she had given birth, the young man informed him saying: ‘Through the grace of God and your prayers, father, she has given birth’. Then Abba Daniel went and said to the young man: ‘Prepare a meal, and invite your neighbours and friends’. ‘When they had eaten, the elder took the baby in his arms and said to is (with everybody watching:) ‘Who is your father’? The child said: ‘That man’, and with the finger of his hand he pointed to the young man. The child was twenty-two days old. Everybody praised the God who is the guardian of truth for those who seek him with their whole hearts.
