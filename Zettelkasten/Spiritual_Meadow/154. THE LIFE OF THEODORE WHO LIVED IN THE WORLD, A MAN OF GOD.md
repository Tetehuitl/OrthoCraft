Abba Jordanes the grazer said:  
 
Three of us anchorites went to Abba Nicholas at the Wadi Betasim- os. He lived in a cave between Saint Elpidios and the monastery known as ‘the Strangers’. We found a stranger close by him and, as we were speaking about the salvation of the soul, Abba Nicholas said to him: ‘You say something to us too’. He replied: “What could I say that would do you any good, I who am a man of the world? Would that I could even do myself some good!” The abba said to him: ‘Indeed, you shall say something to us.’ Then the man of the world said: ‘For twenty years, Saturdays and Sundays excepted, the sun never saw me eating. I am the hired servant on the estate of a rich man who is unjust and greedy. I was with him for fifteen years, toiling night and day, and he would not pay me my wages, but treated me with considerable harshness. I said to myself: “Theodore, if you endure this man, he is going to obtain the kingdom of heaven for you instead of the wages he owes you”. So I kept my body free of contact with women until this day.’ When we heard this, we were greatly edified.
