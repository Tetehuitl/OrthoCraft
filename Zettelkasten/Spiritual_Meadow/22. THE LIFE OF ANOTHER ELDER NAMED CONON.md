[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
In the community of our holy father Theodosios the Archimandrite there was an elder named Conon, a native of Cilicia. This is the rule of life which he maintained for thirty-five years: he partook of bread and water once a week, he worked unceasingly and he never went out of the church.
