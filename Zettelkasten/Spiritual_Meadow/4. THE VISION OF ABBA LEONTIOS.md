[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Abba Leontios of the community of our holy father Theodosios told us: After the new lavriotes were driven out of the New Lavra I went and took up residence in the same lavra. One Sunday I went to the church to make my communion and when I went in, I saw an angel standing at the right side of the altar. When I had received communion I went back to my cell and a voice came to me saying: ‘From the moment that altar was consecrated I was commanded to remain here’.
