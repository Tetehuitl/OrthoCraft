We went to sce Abba Stephan the Cappadocian on Mount Sinai and this is what he told us:  
 
When I was at Mount Sinai some years ago, I was in church on Maundy Thursday. When the holy sacrifice was being offered and all the fathers were present, I looked and saw two anchorites enter the church. They were naked, yet not another of the fathers perceived that they were naked, except me. When they had received the communion of the body and blood of the Lord, they left the church and went away. I went out with them and when we were outside, I prostrated myself before them, saying: ‘Of your charity, take me with you’, for they knew that I had perceived that they were naked, They said to me: ‘You are well installed here: stay where you are’. Again I asked them to take me with them. Then they said to me: ‘It is not possible for you to be with us; stay here: this is the place for you’. They offered a prayer on my behalf and then, before my very eyes, they went onto the water of the Red Sea on foot and departed across the sea.
