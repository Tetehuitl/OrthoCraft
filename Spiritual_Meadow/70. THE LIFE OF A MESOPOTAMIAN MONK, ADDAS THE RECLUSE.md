The elder also told us this: that after Abba David, there came to Thessalonica another monk, also from Mesopotamia, whose name was Adolas. He confined himself in a hollow plane tree in another part of the city. He made a little window in the tree through which he could talk with people who came to see him. When the barbar- ians came and laid waste all the countryside, they happened to pass by that place. One of the barbarians noticed the elder looking down at them, He drew his sword and raised his arm to strike the elder. But he remained there, rooted to the spot with his hand stuck up in the air. When the rest of the barbarians saw this, they were amazed and, falling down before him, they besought the elder (to restore their comrade). The elder offered a prayer and healed him and thus he dismissed them in peace.
