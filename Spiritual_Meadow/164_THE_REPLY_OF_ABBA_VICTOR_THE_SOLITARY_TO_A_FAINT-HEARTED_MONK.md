[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
A brother visited Abba Victor the solitary at the lavra of Eleousa and said to him: ‘What shall I do, father, for I am in the grips of the spiritual disease of faint-heartedness?’ The elder replied: ‘This is a disease of the soul. Just as those who suffer from ophthalmia have  
 
the impression of seeing more light (when their disease is acute) than do those whose eyes are healthy, so too do the faint-hearted quickly take offence at some small neglect and think that neglect to be something of great moment. It is just the opposite with those who are healthy in soul, for they rejoice in their trials.”
