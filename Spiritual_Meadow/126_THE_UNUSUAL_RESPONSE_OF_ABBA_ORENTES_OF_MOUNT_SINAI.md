The same holy fathers told us about Abba Orentés—that one Sunday he went into church with his garment turned inside out, so that the hair was on the outside. As he stood in choir, those who were in authority said to him: ‘Good elder, why have you come in like that, making us a laughing stock before strangers?’ The elder said to them: ‘You have turned Sinai inside out and nobody said anything to you; why do you reproach me for turning my garment? Get on with you! [Restore what you have overturned] and I will regularise what I have altered’.
