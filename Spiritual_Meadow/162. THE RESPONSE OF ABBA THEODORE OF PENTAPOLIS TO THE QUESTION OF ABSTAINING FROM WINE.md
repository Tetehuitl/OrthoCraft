[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Twenty miles from Alexandria, there is a lavra called Calamén, between the eighteenth mile-post and Maphora. There we met Abba Theodore (Sophronios the Sophist was with us) and we asked him if it were permissible to break the rule of abstaining from wine when we were visiting somebody, or when somebody paid us a visit. He said it was not: so we asked him why it was that the fathers of old time would set aside that rule. The elder replied: ‘The fathers of old time were truly great and highly disciplined men who could loosen the rule and then bind it again. This present generation is not strong  
 
enough to loosen the rule and then to bind it again. If we once loosen the rule, we no longer maintain our ascetic way of life.’
