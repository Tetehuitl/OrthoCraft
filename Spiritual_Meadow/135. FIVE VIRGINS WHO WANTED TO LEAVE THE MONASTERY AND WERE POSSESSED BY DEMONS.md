When Brother Sophronios and I visited the Monastery of the Eunuchs by the holy Jordan, Abba Nicholas, the priest of the monastery, told us this:  
 
In my country (he was from Lycia) there is a monastery of virgins housing about forty persons. Five of the virgins in that monastery conspired to run away from the monastery and to find themselves husbands. So one night, when all the nuns were asleep, as they were trying to get into their clothes to run away, all five of them suddenly became possessed by demons. This having happened, they never went out of the monastery again; they were always giving thanks to God and confessing their sins, saying: ‘We give thanks to God, the great giver of gifts, who has inflicted this chastisernent on us to save our souls from perdition’_
