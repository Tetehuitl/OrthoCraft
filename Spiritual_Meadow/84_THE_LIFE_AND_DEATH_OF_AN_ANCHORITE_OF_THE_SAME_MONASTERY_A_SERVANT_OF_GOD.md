[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
The fathers of the same monastery told us this:  
 
There was an anchorite in these mountains, a great man in the eyes of God who survived for many years on the natural vegetation which could be found there. He died in a certain small cave and we did no know, for we imagined that he had gone away to another wilderness place, One night this anchorite appeared to our present father, that good and gentle shepherd, Abba Julian, as he slept, saying to him: “Take some men and go, take me up from the place where I am lying, up on the mountain called The Deer’. So our father took some brethren and went up into the mountain of which he had spoken. We sought for many hours but we did not come across the remains of the anchorite. With the passage of time, the entrance to the cave in which he lay had been covered over by shrubs and snow. As we found nothing, the abba said: ‘Come, children, let us go down’,—and just as we were about to return, a deer approached and came to a standstill some little distance from us. She began to dig in the earth with her hooves. When our father saw this, he said to us: ‘Believe me, children, that is where the servant of God is buried’. We dug there and found his relics intact. We carried him to the monastery and buried him there.
