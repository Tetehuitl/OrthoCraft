The same Abba John said:  
 
When I was a young man I had a longing to go to the great and famous elders, to receive their blessing and to be edified by them. I heard of Abba Calinicos the Great, the recluse at the Monastery of Abba Sabas. I asked one of them who knew him to bring me to him. The elder who had brought me sat down at the window and spoke with the elder through the window for a long time. I told myself that, since the elder had never seen me, he was not going to be inclined to receive me. The elder just mentioned withdrew from the window, bidding me to enter; to greet the elder and to be blessed by him. And he said to him: ‘Father, pray for this, your servant, for it was one of his dearest wishes to come here’. The elder said: ‘But of course, my child; I know him. Twenty days ago I went down to the holy Jordan and he met me on the road and said to me: “Pray for me”, and I asked him: “What is your name?” He answered: “John”. I have known him since then.’ When I heard this I knew that when I had conceived the desire of coming to him, God had revealed to him my name and who I was.
