[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
We went to an estate which was six miles from Rossos and there, two elders living in the world received us as their guests in the church on their property. This estate lay at the foot of a mountain. They showed us some grave-stones in the church and told us: ‘Christians, a great anchorite lies in this tomb’. We asked them how they knew this. ‘Seven years ago’ they replied ‘one night, we who belong to this estate saw a light which looked like a fire on the summit of the mountain, We thought it was because of the wild beasts that a fire had been lit there but we saw it for many days. One day we went up there but we saw no evidence; no lights or anything whatsoever that had been burnt in the woods. Again, the following night we saw the same lights and for three months after that, Then one night we took some local men armed with weapons (on account of the wild animals) and climbed up the mountain towards the light. We stayed there where the light was until dawn. At day-break we noticed a little cave where the lights had appeared and found the anchorite dead. He was wearing a hair-shirt and a tunic of sack-cloth. He was holding a gospel-book enhanced with a silver cross. Beside him we found writing-tablets inscribed thus: “I, the unworthy John, died in the fifteenth indiction”. We calculated the time and discovered that he had been dead for seven years, yet he was as though he had died that very day. We carried him down and buried him in the church."
