At the community of our saintly father Theodosios, Abba Theo- dosios, who subsequently became bishop of Capitolias, told us about Abba Nonnos. ‘One night’, he said, ‘before the wood-en signal was struck for the night office, I was lying in my bunk and I heard someone saying: “Lord have mercy”, in a humble, quiet voice. After counting five hundred repetitions of “Lord, have mercy”, I wanted to know who it was that was speaking. I looked towards the church from the window of my cell and saw the elder, down on his knees. There was a bright star above his head, showing me which elder it was’. Another of the elders of the same community told us this about the same Abba Nonnos: ‘One night before the striking of the wood-en signal I left my cell and went to the church, I saw the  
 elder standing before the church with his hands stretched out to heaven in prayer. His hands shone like lamps of fire; I withdrew in fear’.
