Procopios the lawyer, who came from Porphyreéa, told us this about Abba Zachaios:  
 
There was a deadly plague in Caesarea and I was very worried that my children might die. I did not know what to do, Should I send and bring them home? No man can flee from the wrath of God. Should I leave them there? They might die without me seeing them. Not knowing what was best to be done, I said: ‘I will go to Abba Zachaios and whatever he says, that will I do’. So I went to Holy Sion (which is where he was always to be found), but I did not find him, I came into the inner court [of the Church of Saint Mary the  
 
Mother of God and there I found him, standing in a corner of the court]. I told him about my sons. When he heard this, he turned towards the east and continued reaching up towards heaven for about two hours without saying a word. Than he turned towards me and said: ‘Take heart and do not be distraught: your children shall not die in the plague. In fact, two days from now, the plague shall abate in Caesarea’, [and it came about as the elder foretold. As I said, this is what Procopios the lawyer told us.)
