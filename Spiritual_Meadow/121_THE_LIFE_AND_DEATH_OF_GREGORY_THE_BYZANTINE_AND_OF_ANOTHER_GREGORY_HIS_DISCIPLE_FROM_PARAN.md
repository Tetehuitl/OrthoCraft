[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
The fathers of the same place told us concerning Abba Gregory of Byzantium and his disciple, Abba Gregory from Paran, that they stayed on an island in the Red Sea. Now there was no water on that island: they used to bring the water to supply their needs from the mainland. They had a boat in which they would set out and bring back water. One day they put the boat in the water and tied it to a stone, That night a great wave came and broke the rope, sending the boat to the bottom. Now the fathers were left with no way of providing themselves with water. Eight months later, some monks came from Raithou and found them both dead. They also found a tortoise-shell with this written on it: ‘Abba Gregory of Pharon died after going twenty-eight days without drinking water, but I have gone thirty-seven days without a drink’. We found both the corpses intact: we took them back and buried them at Raithou.
