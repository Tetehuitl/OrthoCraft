At the same Lavra of Pharén, we saw Abba Paul too, a holy man of great humility and self-abegnation, wholly devoted to God; a man who wept many tears each day. I don’t know whether I ever met his like in all my life. For almost fifty years this elder had led the solitary life sustained by nothing more than the charitable dole of the church, for he would accept nothing in addition to the rations he received. He came from Anazarbos.
