[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
At the same Lavra of the Towers there was an elder who practised poverty to an exceptional degree and yet his particular spiritual gift was that of almsgiving. One day a beggar came to his little tower asking for alms. The elder had nothing but a single loaf of bread which he brought out and gave to the beggar. ‘It is not bread I want’ said the beggar; ‘I need clothing’. Wishing to minister to the man’s needs, the elder took him by the hand and led him into his tower. When the beggar found that there was nothing there at all other than what the elder stood up in, he was so impressed by his virtue that he opened his bag and emptied out all its contents in the middle of the cell. ‘Take this, good elder’, he said; ‘I will satisfy my needs elsewhere’.
