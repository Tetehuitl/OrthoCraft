A brother possessed of a demon went to Abba Symeon the Stylite on the Wonderful Mountain to have a prayer offered for him to be rid of the demon. Abba Symeon said to him: ‘Where do you live?’ The elder answered: ‘At Raithou’. The elder answered him: ‘I am surprised at what toil you have endured, what a journey undertaken to come to me, to a mere sinful man, when you have such great fathers in your own lavra. Go, prostrate yourself before Abba  
 
Andrew, asking him to pray for you, and he will hea] you at once. The brother went back to Raithou and prostrated himself before Abba Andrew, as Abba Symeon had instructed him, saying: ‘Pray for me, abba’. Abba Andrew said to him; ‘Abba Symeon has obtained the gift of this healing’. He offered a prayer and the brother was immediately cleansed: and he gave thanks to God.
