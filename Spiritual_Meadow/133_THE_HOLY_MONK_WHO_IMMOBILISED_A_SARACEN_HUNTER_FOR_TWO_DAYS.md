[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
A pagan Saracen told this to the inhabitants of Clisma =Suez and to us:  
 
I went to the mountain of Abba Anthony to hunt. As I went along, I saw a monk on the mountain holding a book and reading. I went up to him intending to rob him; perhaps to slay him too. As I approached him, he stretched out his right hand towards me saying: ‘Stay’! And for two nights and two days I was unable to move from that spot. Then I said to him: ‘For the love of the God whom you worship, let me go’! He said: ‘Go in peace’, and thus I was able to leave the place where I was.
