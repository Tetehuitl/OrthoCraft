[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
One of the holy fathers said that a woman of senatorial rank came to worship at the Holy Places. When she came to Caesarea, it pleased her instead to stay there in solitary retirement Aésuchasai. She asked the bishop to give her a virgin who could train her in religion and teach her the fear of God. The bishop selected a modest virgin and gave her to the great lady. Sometime later the bishop encountered her and asked: ‘How is the virgin I gave you?’ ‘She is fine’, she replied, ‘but not much benefit to my soul because she is so humble that she lets me go my own way. I need somebody who will stand up to me and not let me do whatever I want’. So the bishop took away the first virgin and sent another, a stern one who used to her address her as ‘fool of a rich woman’ and heap similar imprecations upon her. Afterwards, the bishop asked her again how she found the virgin and the lady replied: ‘This one is certainly good for my soul’, and she became distinguished for her humility.
