[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Abba Cyprian, whose surname was Cuculas and whose monastery is outside the gate of Caesarea told us this when we went to see him:  
 
When that savage and horrendous plague ravaged this city, I shut  
 
myself in my cell and prayed the clemency of God to have mercy on us, to turn aside the wrath which threatened us. A voice came to  
 
me, saying: ‘Abba Zachaios has obtained this favour’.
