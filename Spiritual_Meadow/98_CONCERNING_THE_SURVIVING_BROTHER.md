[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
Whilst this brother was staying by the holy Jordan after his brother’s death, an elder came from the Lavra of Calamén and said to him: ‘Tell me, brother: what good has it done you persevering so Jong in silent recollection and self-denial?’ The brother said: ‘Go away and come back in ten days’ time and I will tell you’. The elder came back after ten days and found the brother dead. He found there a piece of broken pottery with this written on it: ‘Forgive me, father, but I have never let my mind remain earth-bound whilst performing my spiritual duties’.
