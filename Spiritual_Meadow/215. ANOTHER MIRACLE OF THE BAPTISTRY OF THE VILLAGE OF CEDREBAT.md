[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
In the village of Cedrebat in the vicinity of the city of Oenoanda there is a font which consists of one single piece of stone. And at the paschal feast of the resurrection it suddenly fills up of its own accord and retains the water until Pentecost. Then suddenly, after Pentecost, the water disappears. Both these wonders are in the Province of Lycia. If anybody does not believe this, it is no burdensome journey to Lycia where he can inform himself of the trath.
