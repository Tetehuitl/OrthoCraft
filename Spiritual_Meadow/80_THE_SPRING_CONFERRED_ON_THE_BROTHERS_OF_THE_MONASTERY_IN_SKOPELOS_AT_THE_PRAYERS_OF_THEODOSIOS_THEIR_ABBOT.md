[[Spiritual Meadow]]
 
We came to the monastery of Abba Theodosios at Skopelos =the rock. There is a mountain between inland Seleucia and Rossos in Cilicia. The fathers of this monastery led us up beyond the monas- tery about as far as an arrow could be shot. There they showed us a spring, saying that it gave a plentiful supply of excellent water and that it was a gift of God to them. ‘It is not a natural occurrence’ they said, ‘but was given to us by divine intervention. Our saintly father Theodosios the Great fasted at great length and poured forth tears, making many genuflexions in prayer to God that he would grant us the comfort of this water. In former times our fathers used to draw their water from the wadi. But God who always does the will of those that fear him Ps 144:19 granted us the blessing of water through the prayers of our father. Two years ago some of the brethren asked the higoumen if they might construct a bath in the monastery. Our higoumen frowned on this suggestion but allowed it as a concession to the weakness of the brethren. The bath was built, but they bathed no more than the one time; for this beautiful spring which God had provided promptly faltered and failed. We tell you no less than the truth in saying that we fasted a great deal and offered up many intercessions with much tears—and still no water came from the spring. It was dry for a whole year and we were in great distress. Then our father destroyed the bath—and God gave us water again!
