Some of the fathers of Sinai told us this about Abba Sergios the anchorite: When he was living at Sinai, the steward put him in charge of the mules, One day, as he went his way, there was a lion lying in his path. When the mules and the muleteer saw the lion, they were stricken with fear—and they took to their heels. Then Abba Sergios took a holy bread-ration eu/ogia out of his pack and went up to the lion, saying to it: ‘Take the ration of the fathers and get out of the way, so that we can pass by’. The lion took the ration and went away.
